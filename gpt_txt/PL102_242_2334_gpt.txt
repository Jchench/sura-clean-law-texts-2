Subtitle F—Truth in Savings

SEC. 261. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the “Truth in Savings Act”.

SEC. 262. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) Findings.—The Congress hereby finds that economic stability would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened if there was uniformity in the disclosure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in connection with such accounts.

(b) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this subtitle to require the clear and uniform disclosure of—

(1) the rates of interest which are payable on deposit accounts by depository institutions; and

(2) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts, so that consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts.

SEC. 263. DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST RATES AND TERMS OF ACCOUNTS.

(a) In General.—Except as provided in subsection (b), each advertisement, announcement, or solicitation initiated by any depository institution or deposit broker relating to any demand or interest-bearing account offered by an insured depository institution which includes any reference to a specific rate of interest payable on amounts deposited in such account, or to a specific yield or rate of earnings on amounts so deposited, shall state the following information, to the extent applicable, in a clear and conspicuous manner:

(1) The annual percentage yield.

(2) The period during which such annual percentage yield is in effect.

(3) All minimum account balance and time requirements which must be met in order to earn the advertised yield (and, in the case of accounts for which more than one yield is stated, each annual percentage yield and the account minimum balance requirement associated with each such yield shall be in close proximity and have equal prominence).

(4) The minimum amount of the initial deposit which is required to open the account in order to obtain the yield advertised, if such minimum amount is greater than the minimum balance necessary to earn the advertised yield.

(5) A statement that regular fees or other conditions could reduce the yield.

(6) A statement that an interest penalty is required for early withdrawal.

(b) Broadcast and Electronic Media and Outdoor Advertising Exception.—The Board may, by regulation, exempt advertisements, announcements, or solicitations made by any broadcast or electronic medium or outdoor advertising not on the premises of the depository institution from any disclosure requirements described in paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (a) if the Board finds that any such disclosure would be unnecessarily burdensome.

(c) Misleading Descriptions of Free or No-Cost Accounts Prohibited.—No advertisement, announcement, or solicitation made by any depository institution or deposit broker may refer to or describe an account as a free or no-cost account (or words of similar meaning) if—

(1) in order to avoid fees or service charges for any period—

(A) a minimum balance must be maintained in the account during such period; or

(B) the number of transactions during such period may not exceed a maximum number; or

(2) any regular service or transaction fee is imposed.

 error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.

(2) Examples.—Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a depository institution’s obligation under this Act is not a bona fide error.

(B) any action is instituted against the depository institution by the account holder under this section with respect to such failure to comply; and

(C) any written notice of such failure to comply is received by the depository institution from the account holder, the depository institution notifies the account holder of the failure of such institution to comply with such requirement; and

(2) the depository institution makes such adjustments as may be necessary with respect to such account to ensure that—

(A) the account holder will not be liable for any amount in excess of the amount actually disclosed with respect to such fee or charge;

(B) the account holder will not be liable for any fee or charge imposed under any condition not actually disclosed; and

(C) interest on amounts in such account will accrue at the annual percentage yield, and under the conditions, actually disclosed (and credit will be provided for interest already accrued at a different annual percentage yield and under different conditions than the yield or conditions disclosed).

(h) Multiple Interests in 1 Account.—If more than 1 person holds an interest in any account—

(1) the minimum and maximum amounts of liability under subsection (a)(2)(A) for any failure to comply with the requirements of this Act shall apply with respect to such account; and

(2) the court shall determine the manner in which the amount of any such liability with respect to such account shall be distributed among such persons.

(i) Continuing Failure to Disclose.—

(1) Certain Continuing Failures Treated as 1 Violation.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the continuing failure of any depository institution to disclose any particular term required to be disclosed under this Act with respect to a particular account shall be treated as a single violation for purposes of determining the amount of any liability of such institution under subsection (a) for such failure to disclose.

(2) Subsequent Failure to Disclose.—The continuing failure of any depository institution to disclose any particular term required to be disclosed under this Act with respect to a particular account after judgment has been rendered in favor of the account holder in connection with a prior failure to disclose such term with respect to such account shall be treated as a subsequent violation for purposes of determining liability under subsection (a).

(3) Coordination with Section 270.—This subsection shall not limit or otherwise affect the enforcement power under section 270 of any agency referred to in subsection (a) of such section.

SEC. 272. CREDIT UNIONS.
