TITLE I—REGULATION OF INTEREST RATES

Sec. 101. Section 7 of the Act of September 21, 1966 (Public Law 89-597), is amended by striking out “December 31, 1975” and inserting in lieu thereof “March 1, 1977”.

Sec. 102. (a) An interest rate differential for any category of deposits or accounts which is in effect on December 10, 1975, between (1) any bank (other than a savings bank) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and (2) any savings and loan, building and loan, or homestead association (including cooperative banks) the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or any mutual savings bank as defined in section 3(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(f)) may not be eliminated or reduced unless—

(B) the House of Representatives and the Senate approve, by concurrent resolution, the proposed elimination or reduction of the interest rate differential.

(b) In the case of the elimination or reduction of any interest rate differential under subsection (a) with respect to any category of deposits or accounts between (1) any bank (other than a savings bank) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and (2) any savings and loan, building and loan, or homestead association (including cooperative banks) the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or any mutual savings bank as defined in section 3(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(f)), the maximum rate of interest which shall be established for such category of deposits for banks (other than savings banks) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall be equal to the highest rate of interest which savings and loan associations the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were permitted to charge for such category of deposits immediately prior to the elimination or reduction of such interest rate differential.

TITLE III—HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE

SHORT TITLE

Sec. 301. This title may be cited as the “Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975”.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

Sec. 302. (a) The Congress finds that some depository institutions have sometimes contributed to the decline of certain geographic areas by their failure pursuant to their affirmative responsibilities to provide adequate home financing to qualified applicants on reasonable terms and conditions.

(b) The purpose of this title is to provide the citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether depository institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located and to assist public officials in their determination of the distribution of public sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private investment environment.

(c) Nothing in this title is intended to, nor shall it be construed to, encourage unsound lending practices or the allocation of credit.

(2) The information required to be maintained and made available under paragraph (1) shall also be itemized in order to clearly and conspicuously disclose the following:

For the purposes of this paragraph, a depository institution which maintains offices in more than one standard metropolitan statistical area shall be required to make the information required by this paragraph available at any such office only to the extent that such information relates to mortgage loans which were originated or purchased by an office of that depository institution located in the standard metropolitan statistical area in which the office making such information available is located.

(3) Any item of information relating to mortgage loans required to be maintained under subsection (a) shall be further itemized in order to disclose for each such item—

(2) the number and dollar amount of mortgage loans made to mortgagors who did not, at the time of execution of the mortgage, intend to reside in the property securing the mortgage loan; and
(3) the number and dollar amount of home improvement loans.

(c) Any information required to be compiled and made available under this section shall be maintained and made available for a period of five years after the close of the first year during which such information is required to be maintained and made available.

ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 305. (a) The Board shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this title. These regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of this title, and prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.

(b) Compliance with the requirements imposed under this title shall be enforced under—

(1) section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the case of—
(A) national banks, by the Comptroller of the Currency;
(B) member banks of the Federal Reserve System, other than national banks, by the Board;

(c) For the purpose of the exercise by any agency referred to in subsection (b) of its powers under any Act referred to in that subsection, a violation of any requirement imposed under this title shall be deemed to be a violation of a requirement

 imposed under that Act. In addition to its powers under any provision of law specifically referred to in subsection (b), each of the agencies referred to in that subsection may exercise, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with any requirement imposed under this title, any other authority conferred on it by law.

Sec. 306. (a) This title does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any depository institution subject to the provisions of this title from complying with, the laws of any State or subdivision thereof with respect to public disclosure and recordkeeping by depository institutions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this title, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.

(b) The Board is authorized to determine whether any such inconsistency exists. The Board may not determine that any such law is inconsistent with any provision of this title if the Board determines that such law requires the maintenance of records with greater disclosure than the requirements under this title, or requires reports which encompass a broader scope than that required under this title.

(c) The Board shall, by regulation, exempt from the requirements of this title any State-chartered depository institution within any State or subdivision thereof if the Board determines that the requirements of that State or subdivision are substantially similar to those imposed under this title.
