“(3) SIGNIFICANCE OF BLOCK.—For purposes of this sub-
section, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the

consumer reporting agencies in providing such consumer
reports;

‘In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender
must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency
distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your
home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.

‘The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated
at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer
reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on
data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores
are important because they are used to assist the lender in deter-
mining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used
to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage.
Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct,
how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how
credit scoring technologies change.

‘Because the score is based on information in your credit his-
tory, it is very important that you review the credit-related informa-
tion that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit
records may vary from one company to another.

‘If you have questions about your credit score or the credit
information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting
agency at the address and telephone number provided with this
notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated
the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part
in the decision to take any action on the loan application and
is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision
on a loan application.

‘If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact
the lender.’.

to the consumer for that loan transaction.

pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to
providing a copy of the information that was received
from the consumer reporting agency.

“Gi) LIMIT ON LIABILITY.—No person has liability
under this subsection for the content of that informa-
tion or for the omission of any information within
the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.

spicuous statement that a key factor (as defined in section
609(f)(2)(B)) that adversely affected such score or predictor

note.

ABILITY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS.

(a) STUDY REQUIRED.—The Commission and the Board, in con-

sultation with the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, shall con-
duct a study of—

(1) the effects of the use of credit scores and credit-based

insurance scores on the availability and affordability of financial

ysis that controls for prohibited factors under the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act and other known risk factors, between credit
PUBLIC LAW 108—159—DEC. 4, 2003 117 STAT. 1985

scores and credit-based insurance scores and the quantifiable

risks and actual losses experienced by businesses;

(3) the extent to which, if any, the use of credit scoring
models, credit scores, and credit-based insurance scores impact
on the availability and affordability of credit and insurance
to the extent information is currently available or is available
through proxies, by geography, income, ethnicity, race, color,
religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, and creed,
including the extent to which the consideration or lack of consid-
eration of certain factors by credit scoring systems could result
in negative or differential treatment of protected classes under
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the extent to which,
if any, the use of underwriting systems relying on these models
could achieve comparable results through the use of factors
with less negative impact; and

(4) the extent to which credit scoring systems are used
by businesses, the factors considered by such systems, and
the effects of variables which are not considered by such sys-
tems.

(b) PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.—The Commission shall seek public

the study described in subsection (a), including from relevant Fed-
