TITLE X—RESIDENTIAL LEAD-BASED
PAINT HAZARD REDUCTION ACT OF
1992

SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE.

This title may be cited as the “Residential Lead-Based Paint
Hazard Reduction Act of 1992”.

SEC, 1002. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds that—
(1) low-level lead poisoning is pe ge among American
ildren, afflicting as many as 3,000, children under age
6, with minority and low-income communities disproportion-
ately affected;

(2) at low levels, lead poisoning in children causes intel-
ligence quotient deficiencies, reading and learning disabilities,
impai hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, and
behavior problems;

(3) pre-1980 American housing stock contains more than
3,000,000 tons of lead in the form of lead-based paint, with
the vast majority of homes built before 1950 containing substan-
tial amounts of lead-based paint;

(4) the ingestion of household dust containing lead from
deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint is the most common
cause of poisoning in children;

(5) the health and development of children Being. in as
many as 3,800,000 American homes is endangered by chipping
or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-contami-
nate(e) the danger "pone by lead-based paint hazards be

r 'y - pain can
reduced by abating lead-based paint or by taking interim meas-
ures to prevent paint deterioration and limit children’s exposure
to lead dust and chips;

(7) — the enactment of laws in the early 1970's requir-
ing the Federal Government to eliminate as far as practicable
lead-based paint hazards in federally owned, assisted, and
insured housing, the Federal response to this national crisis
remains severely limited; and

(8) the Federal Government must take a leadership role
in building the infrastructure—including an informed public,
State and local delivery systems, certified inspectors, contrac-
tors, and laboratories, trained workers, and available pong.
and insurance—necessary to ensure that the national goal o
eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing can be
achieved as expeditiously as possible.

Subtitle B—Required Capital Levels for
Enterprises and Special Enforcement
Powers

SEC, 1361, RISK-BASED CAPITAL LEVELS.

(a) Risk-BASED CAPITAL TEST.—The Director shall, by regula-
tion, establish a risk-based capital test under this section for the
enterprises. When a to an enterprise, the risk-based capital
test s determine the amount of total capital for the enterprise
that is sufficient for the enterprise to maintain positive capital
during a 10-year oF aby in which the following circumstances occur
(in this section referred to as the “stress period”):

(1) CREDIT RISK.—With respect to mo owned or
guaranteed by the enterprise and other obligations of the enter-
prise, -losses occur throughout the Uni States at a rate
of default and severity (based on any measurements of default
reasonably related to prevailing practice for that industry in
determining capital seine reasonably related to the rate
and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United
States containing an gate of not less than 5 percent of
the total population of the United States that, for a period
of not less than 2 years, experienced the highest rates of default
and severity of mo: losses, in comparison with such rates
of default and severity of mortgage losses in other such areas
for any period of such duration.

(2) RATE RISK.—

(A) IN GENERAL.—Interest rates decrease as described
in subparagraph (B) or increase as described in subpara-
graph (C), whichever would require more capital for the
enterprise.

(B) DECREASES.—The 10-year constant maturity Treas-
ury yield decreases during the first year of the stress
period and will remain at the new level for the remainder
of the stress period. The yield decreases to the lesser of—

(i) 600 basis points below the average yield during
the preceding 9 months, or

(ii) 60 percent of the average yield during the
preceding 3 years, —

but in no case to a yield less than 50 percent of the

average yield during the preceding 9 months.

(C) INCREASES.—The 10-year constant maturity Treas-
ury yield increases during the first year of the stress period
and will remain at the new level for the remainder of
the stress period. The yield increases to the greater of—

(i) 600 basis points above the average yield during
the preceding 9 months, or

(ii) 160 percent of the average yield during the
preceding 3 years, —

but in no case to a yield greater than 175 percent of

the average yield during the preceding 9 months.

(D) DIFFERENT TERMS TO MATURITY.—Yields of Treas-

instruments with other terms to maturity will
colative to the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield
in patterns and for durations that are reasonably related
PUBLIC LAW 102-550—OCT. 28, 1992 106 STAT. 3973

to historical experience and are judged reasonable by the
Director.

(E) LARGE INCREASES IN YIELDS.—If the 10-year con-
stant maturity Treasury yield is assumed to increase by
more than 50 percent over the — yield during the
preceding 9 months, the Director adjust the losses
in paragraphs (1) and (3) to reflect a correspondingly higher
rate of general price inflation.

(3) NEW BUSINESS,—

(A) IN GENERAL.—Any contractual commitments of the
enterprise to purchase mortgages or issue securities will
be fulfilled. The characteristics of resulting mortgage pur-
chases, securities issued, and other financing will be
consistent with the contractual terms of such commitments,
recent experience, and the economic characteristics of the
stress period. No other purchases of mortgages shall be
assumed, except as provided in sub: ph (B).

(B) ADDITIONAL NEW BUSINESS.— Director may,
after consideration of each of the studies required by
subparagraph (C), assume that the entergrise conducts
additional new business during the stress period consistent
with the following—

(i) AMOUNT AND PRODUCT TYPES.—The amount and
types of mortgages purchased and their financing will
be reasonably related to recent experience and the
economic characteristics of the stress period.

(ii) Losses.—Default and loss severity characteris-
tics of mortgages purchased will be reasonably related
to historical experience.

(iii) PRICING.—Prices charged by the enterprise in
purchasing new mortgages will be reasonably related
to recent experience the economic characteristics
of the stress period. The Director may assume that
a reasonable period of time would la before the
enterprise would recognize and react to the characteris-
tics of the stress period.

(iv) INTEREST RATE RISK.—Interest rate risk on
new ne urchased will occur to an extent
reasonably re to historical experience.

(v) RESERVES.—The enterprise must maintain
reserves during and at the of the stress period
on new business conducted during the first 5 years
of the stress period reasonably related to the
future losses on such business, consistent with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles and industry
accounting practice.

(C) STUDIES.—Within 1 year after regulations are first
issued under subsection (e), the Director of the Co -
sional Budget Office, and the Comptroller General of the
United States shall each submit to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the
Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the
House of Og ws pote a study of the advisability and
