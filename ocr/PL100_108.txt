SEC, 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 12 USC 5001.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:

(1) In the Expedited Funds Availability Act, enacted on
August 10, 1987, the Congress directed the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing regula-
tions requiring Federal reserve banks and depository institu-
tions to provide for check truncation, in order to improve the
check processing system.

(2) In that same Act, the Congress—

(A) provided the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System with full authority to regulate all aspects
of the payment system, including the receipt, payment,
collection, and clearing of checks, and related functions
of the payment system pertaining to checks; and
117 STAT. 1178 PUBLIC LAW 108-—100—OCT. 28, 2003

(B) directed that the exercise of such authority by
the Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform
Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.

(3) Check truncation is no less desirable in 2003 for both
financial service customers and the financial services industry,
to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check collections, and
expedite funds availability for customers than it was over 15
years ago when Congress first directed the Board to consider
establishing such a process.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are as follows:

(1) To facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute
checks.

(2) To foster innovation in the check collection system
without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.

(3) To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation’s pay-
ments system.

party; and

check, the claimant bank shall promptly refund to any indem-

nifying bank any amount previously advanced by the indem-

nifying bank in connection with such substitute check.

GOVERNED BY SECTION 6(d).—If the indemnifying bank provides
the claimant bank with the original check or a copy of the original
check (including an image or a substitute check) under subsection

bank to any repayment of any funds the indemnifying bank has

(ii) the amount of the substitute check; and
(B) interest and expenses (including costs and reason-
able attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation)
related to the substitute check.

person receives under paragraph (1), if any, shall be reduced
by the amount, if any, that the claimant receives and retains
as a recredit under section 7 or 8.

(b) COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—If a person incurs damages that resulted
in whole or in part from the negligence or failure of that

SEC. 19. DEPOSITARY SERVICES EFFICIENCY AND COST REDUCTION. 12 USC 5018.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:

(1) The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated
financial institutions for various critical depositary and finan-
cial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United
States by—

(A) placing large balances, commonly referred to as
compensating balances”, on deposit at such institutions;
an

(B) using imputed interest on such funds to offset
charges for the various depositary and financial agency
services provided to or on behalf of the Government.

(2) As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over
the last few years to record low levels, or the public debt
outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department
of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or
decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at
these financial institutions.

(3) The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the
necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to
secure the value of compensating balances placed with those
institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for
117 STAT. 1192

PUBLIC LAW 108-—100—OCT. 28, 2003

the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by
financial institutions of their cash and securities.

(4) It is imperative that the process for providing financial
services to the Government be transparent, and provide the
information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise
its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.

(5) The use of direct payment for services rendered would
strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the
Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no
longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of
such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when
the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.

(6) An alternative to the use of compensating balances,
such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure
that payments to financial institutions for the services they
provide would be made in a more predictable manner and
could result in cost savings.

(7) Limiting the use of compensating balances could result
in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those
services currently provided under compensating balance
arrangements.

(8) A transition from the use of compensating balances
to another compensation method must be carefully managed
to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable
participating financial institutions to modify their planned
investment of cash and securities.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SERVICES REN-

DERED BY DEPOSITARIES AND FINANCIAL AGENCIES OF THE UNITED
STATES.—There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years
beginning after fiscal year 2003 to the Secretary of the Treasury
such sums as may be necessary for reimbursing financial institu-
tions in their capacity as depositaries and financial agents of the
United States for all services required or directed by the Secretary
of the Treasury, or a designee of the Secretary, to be performed
by such financial institutions on behalf of the Secretary of the
Treasury or another Federal agency, including services rendered
before fiscal year 2004.

(c) ORDERLY TRANSITION.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—As appropriations authorized in sub-
section (b) become available, the Secretary of the Treasury
shall promptly begin the process of phasing in the use of
the appropriations to pay financial institutions serving as
depositaries and financial agents of the United States, and
transitioning from the use of compensating balances to fund
these services.

(2) POST-TRANSITION USE LIMITED TO EXTRAORDINARY CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—

(A) IN GENERAL.—Following the transition to the use
of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Sec-
retary of the Treasury may use the compensating balances
to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and
financial agents of the United States only in extraordinary
situations where the Secretary determines that they are
needed to ensure the fiscal operations of the Government
continue to function in an efficient and effective manner.

(B) REPORT.—Any use of compensating balances pursu-
ant to subparagraph (A) shall promptly be reported by
PUBLIC LAW 108-—100—OCT. 28, 2003 117 STAT. 1193

the Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee on Finan-

cial Services of the House of Representatives and the Com-

mittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the

Senate.

(3) REQUIREMENTS FOR ORDERLY  TRANSITION.—In
transitioning to the use of the appropriations authorized in
subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury shall take such
steps as may be appropriate to—

(A) prevent abrupt financial disruption to the functions
of the Department of the Treasury or to the participating
financial institutions; and

(B) maintain adequate accounting and management
controls to ensure that payments to financial institutions
for their banking services provided to the Government as
depositaries and financial agents are accurate and that
the arrangements last no longer than is necessary.

(4) REPORTS REQUIRED.—

(A) ANNUAL REPORT.—

(i) IN GENERAL.—For each fiscal year, the Secretary Deadlines.
of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress
on the use of compensating balances and on the use
of appropriations authorized in subsection (b) during
that fiscal year.

(ii) INCLUSION IN BUDGET.—The report required
under clause (i) may be submitted as part of the budget
submitted by the President under section 1105 of title
31, United States Code, for the following fiscal year
and if so, the report shall be submitted concurrently
to the Committee on Financial Services of the House
of Representatives and the Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.

(B) FINAL REPORT FOLLOWING TRANSITION.—

Gi) IN GENERAL.—Following completion of the
transition from the use of compensating balances to
the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection
(b) to pay financial institutions for their services as
depositaries and financial agents of the United States,
the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report
on the transition to the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.

(ii) CONTENTS OF REPORT.—The report submitted
under clause (i) shall include a detailed analysis of—

(I) the cost of transition;
(II) the direct costs of the services being paid
from the appropriations authorized in subsection

(b); and

(III) the benefits realized from the use of direct
payment for such services, rather than the use
of compensating balance arrangements.

(d) TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.—The second undesignated para-
graph of section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 412)
is amended—

(1) in the third sentence, by inserting “or any other asset
