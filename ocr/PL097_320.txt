“Sec. 5. (a) In order to provide thrift institutions for the deposit or
investment of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and
other goods and services, the Board is authorized, under such rules
and regulations as it may prescribe, to provide for the organization,
incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of associ-
ations to be known as Federal savings and loan associations, or
Federal savings banks, and to issue charters therefor, giving pri-
mary consideration to the best practices of thrift institutions in the
United States. The lending and investment authorities are conferred

to maintain their role of providing credit for housing.”’.

DEMAND ACCOUNTS AND CAPITAL STOCK
Sec. 312. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 5(b) of the Home

‘Owners’ Loan Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 1464(b)) are amended to read as

follows:

“(1(A) An association may raise capital in the form of such
savings deposits, shares, or other accounts, for fixed, minimum, or
indefinite periods of time (all of which are referred to in this section
as savings accounts), or in the form of such demand accounts of
those persons or organizations that have a business, corporate,
commercial, or agricultural loan relationship with the association as
are authorized by its charter or by regulations of the Board, and
may issue such passbooks, time certificates of deposit, or other
evidence of accounts as are so authorized.

“(B) An association may also accept demand accounts from a
commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural entity for the sole
purpose of effectuating payments thereto by a nonbusiness cus-
tomer. An association may not pay interest on a demand account. All
savings accounts and demand accounts shall have the same priority
upon liquidation. Holders of accounts and obligors of an association
shall, to such extent as may be provided by its charter or by
regulations of the Board, be members of the association, and shall
PUBLIC LAW 97-320—OCT. 15, 1982 96 STAT. 1497

have such voting rights and such other rights as are thereby
provided.

“(C) Except as may be otherwise authorized by an association’s
charter or regulation of the Board in the case of savings accounts for
fixed or minimum terms of not less than fourteen days, the payment
of any savings account shall be subject to the right of the association
to require such advance notice, not less than fourteen days, as shall
ps baer for by the charter of the association or the regulations of
the Board.

“(D) The Benes’ of withdrawals from accounts in the event an
association does not pay all withdrawals in full (subject to the right
of the association, where applicable, to require notice) shall be
subject to such rules and procedures as may be prescribed by the
association’s charter or by regulation of the Board, but any associ-
ation which, except as authorized in writing by the Board, fails to
make full payment of any withdrawal when due shall be deemed to
be in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business within the
meaning of subsection (d) of this section.

“(E) Accounts may be subject to check or to withdrawal or trans-
fer on negotiable or transferable or other order or authorization to
the association, as the Board may by regulation provide.

“(F) Notwithstanding any limitation of this section, associations
may establish remote service units for the purpose of crediting
savings or demand accounts, debiting such accounts, crediting pay-
ments on loans, and the disposition of related financial transactions,
as provided in regulations ribed by the Board.

“(2) To such extent as the Board may authorize by regulation or
advice in writing, an association may borrow, may give security,
may be surety as defined by the Board and may issue such notes,
bonds, debentures, or other obligations, or other securities, including
capital stock, as the Board may so authorize.”.

Board shall prescribe, and thereafter the converted association shall
be entitled to all the benefits of this section and shall be subject to
examination and regulation to the same extent as other associations
incorporated pursuant to this Act.

association may convert itself from the mutual form to the stock
form of organization, or from the stock form to the mutual form, and

savings and loan association to a Federal savings bank, or the
reverse.

and loan or savings bank of institution organized pursuant to
the laws of the State, district, commonwealth, or territory (herein-
after referred to in this section as the ‘State’) in which the principal
office of such Federal association is located if—

subtracting the amount of total reservable liabilities on June 30
of the calendar year involved from the amount of total reserv-
able liabilities on June 30 of the previous calendar year.”’.

SHORT TITLE pia Act of
Sec. 801. This title may be cited as the “Alternative Mortgage 12 USC 3801
Transaction Parity Act of 1982”. note.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

Sec. 802. (a) The Congress hereby finds that— 12 USC 3801.

(1) increasingly volatile and dynamic changes in interest rates
have seriously impared the ability of housing creditors to pro-
vide consumers with fixed-term, fixed-rate credit secured by
interests in real property, cooperative housing, manufactured
homes, and other dwellings;

(2) alternative mortgage transactions are essential to the
provision of an adequate supply of credit secured by residential
property necessary to meet the demand expected during the
1980’s; and

(3) the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit
Union Administration, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
have recognized the importance of alternative mortgage trans-
actions and have adopted regulations authorizing federally
chartered depository institutions to engage in alternative mort-
gage financing.

(b) It is the purpose of this title to eliminate the discriminatory
impact that those regulations have upon nonfederally chartered
housing creditors and provide them with parity with federally char-
tered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make,
purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as
the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by
the Federal agencies.

cable regulatory requirements and enforcement mechanisms
provided by State law.

chartered depository institutions, and other nonfederally chartered
housing creditors, with respect to making, purchasing, and enforc-
ing alternative mortgage transactions, housing creditors may make,
purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions, except
that this section shall apply—

(1) with respect to banks, only to transactions made in accord-
ance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transac-

banks, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by
rulemaking authority granted to the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency with regard to national banks under Jaws other than this
section;

federally chartered savings and loan associations under laws
other than this section.

accordance with the applicable regulation notwithstanding the
housing creditor’s failure to comply with the regulation, if—

regulation; and

(2) within sixty days of discovering any error, the housing
creditor corrects such error, including making appropriate
adjustments, if any, to the account.

(c) An alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a hous-
ing creditor in accordance with this section, notwithstanding any
State constitution, law, or regulation.
