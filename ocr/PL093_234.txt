AN ACT

To expand the national fiood insurance program by substantially increasing
limits of coverage and total amount of insurance authorized to be outstanding
and by requiring known flood-prone communities to participate in the pro-
gram, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may
be cited as the “Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973”.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

Src. 2. (a) The Congress finds that—

@) annual losses throughout the Nation from floods and mud-
slides are increasing at an alarming rate, largely as a result of
the accelerating development of, and concentration of population
in, areas of flood and mudslide hazards;

(2) the availability of Federal loans, grants, guaranties,
insurance, and other forms of financial assistance are often
determining factors in the utilization of land and the location
and construction of public and of private industrial, commercial,
and residential facilities;

(3) property acquired or constructed with grants or other
Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods,
thus frustrating the purpose for which such assistance was
extended ;

(4) Federal instrumentalities insure or otherwise provide
financial protection to banking and credit institutions whose assets
include a substantial number of mortgage loans and other indebt-
edness secured by property exposed to loss and damage from
floods and mudslides ;

PUBLIC LAW 93-234—DEC. 31, 1973 (87 Stat.

(5) the Nation cannot afford the tragic losses of life caused
annually by flood occurrences, nor the increasing losses of prop-
erty suffered by flood victims, most of whom are still inadequately
a a despite the provision of costly disaster relief bene-

ts; an

(6) it is in the public interest for persons already living in
flood-prone areas to have both an opportunity to purchase flood
insurance and access to more adequate limits of coverage. so that
they will be indemnified for their losses in the event of future
flood disasters.

(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to—

1) substantially increase the limits of coverage authorized
under the national flood insurance program ;

(2) provide for the expeditious identification of, and the dis-
semination of information concerning, flood-prone areas;

(3) require States or local communities, as a condition of
future Federal financial assistance, to participate in the flood
insurance program and to adopt adequate flood plain ordinances
with effective enforcement provisions consistent with Federal
standards to reduce or avoid future flood losses; and

(4) require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners
who are being assisted by Federal programs or by federally
supervised, regulated, or insured agencies or institutions in the
acquisition or improvement of land or facilities located or to be
located in identified areas having special flood hazards.

improved real estate or a mobile home located or to be located in an
area that has been identified by the Secretary as an area having special

December 31, 1974, or the effective date of the initial rate map pub-
lished by the Secretary under paragraph (2) of section 1360 for the

(or subdivision thereof) under section 1307 (a) (1).”.

Sec. 108. (a) Section 1302 of the National Flood Insurance Act of

section :

“(g) The Congress also finds that (1) the damage and loss which
may result from the erosion and undermining of shorelines by waves
or currents in lakes and other bodies of water exceeding anticipated
cyclical levels is related in cause and similar in effect to that which
results directly from storms, deluges, overflowing waters, and other
forms of flooding, and (2) the problems involved in providing protec-
tion against this damage and loss, and the possibilities for making such
protection available through a Federal or federally sponsored pro-
gram, are similar to those which exist in connection with efforts to
provide protection against damage and loss caused by such other forms
of flooding. It is therefore the further purpose of this title to make
available, by means of the methods, procedures, and instrumentalities
which are otherwise established or available under this title for pur-
poses of the flood insurance program, protection against damage and
loss resulting from the erosion and undermining of shorelines by waves

ing anticipated cyclical levels, and all of the provisions of this title

determination may appeal such determination to the local govern-
ment. The sole basis for such appeal shall be the possession of know]-

designate, and shall set forth the data that tend to negate or contradict
the Secretary’s finding in such form as the chief executive officer ma
specify. The community shall review and consolidate all such appeals
and issue a written opinion stating whether the evidence presented is
sufficient to justify an appeal on behalf of such persons by the com-
munity in its own name. Whether or not the community decides to
appeal the Secretary’s determination, copies of individual appeals
shall be sent to the Secretary as they are received by the community,
and the community’s appeal or a copy of its decision not to appeal
shall be filed with the Secretary not later than ninety days after the

community within the ninety days provided, he shall consolidate and
review on their own merits, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in subsection (e), the appeals filed within the community by private
persons and shall make such modifications of his proposed determina-
tions as may be appropriate, taking into account the written opinion,

munity not already participating in the national flood insurance pro-
gram of its tentative identification as a community containing one
or more areas having special flood hazards. ;

(b) After such notification, each tentatively identified community
shall either 1) promptly make proper application to participate in
the national flood insurance program or (2) within six months submit
technical data sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary
that the community either is not seriously flood prone or that such flood
hazards as may have existed have been corrected by floodworks or
other flood control methods. The Secretary may, in his discretion,
grant a public hearing to any community with respect to which con-
flicting data exist as to the nature and extent of a flood hazard. If
the Secretary decides not to hold a hearing, the community shall be
given an opportunity to submit written and documentary evidence.
Whether or not such hearing is granted, the Secretary’s final deter-
mination as to the existence or extent of a flood hazard area in a par-
ticular community shall be deemed conclusive for the purposes of this
ia! supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as
a whole.

(c) As information becomes available to the Secretary concerning
the existence of flood hazards in communities not known to be flood
prone at the time of the initial notification provided for by subsection
(a) of this section he shall provide similar notifications to the chief
executive officers of such additional communities, which shall then be
subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

(d) Formally identified flood-prone communities that do not qualify
for the national flood insurance program within one year after suc
notification or by the date specified in section 202, whichever is later,
shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of that section relating to
flood-prone communities which are not participating in the program.

assistance for acquisition or construction purposes on and after July 1,

area having special flood hazards unless the community in which such
area is situated is then participating in the national flood insurance
program.

(b) Each Federal instrumentality responsible for the supervision,
approval, regulation, or insuring of banks, savings and loan associa-
tions, or similar institutions shall by regulation prohibit such institu-
tions on and after July 1, 1975, from making, increasing, extending,
or renewing any loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home
located or to be located in an area that has been identified by the
Secretary as an area having special flood hazards, unless the com-
munity in which such area is situated is then participating in the

studies, the Secretary shall establish procedures assuring adequate
consultation with the appropriate elected officials of general purpose
local governments, including but not limited to those local govern-
ments whose prior onenalty under the program has been suspended.
