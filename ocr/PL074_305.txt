{Pus. 305.) 5

“(f) (1) Every bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve
System which on June 30, 19385 was or thereafter became a member
of the Temporary Federal Deposit Insurance Fund or of the Fund
For Mutuals heretofore created pursuant to the provisions of this
section, shall be and continue to be, without application or approval,
an insured bank and shall be subject to the provisions of this section:
Provided, That any State nonmember bank which was admitted to
the said Temporary Federal Deposit Insurance Fund or the Fund
For Mutuals but which did not file on or before the effective date
an October 1, 1934 certified statement and make the payments thereon
required by law, shall cease to be an insured bank on August 31,
1935: Provided further, That no bank admitted to the said Tem-
porary Federal Deposit Insurance Fund or the Fund For Mutuals
prior to the effective date shall, after August 31, 1935, be an insured
bank or have its deposits insured by the Corporation, if such bank
shall have permanently discontinued its banking cperations prior to
the effective date.

“(2) Subject to the provisions of this section, any national non-
member bank, upon application by the bank and certification by the
Comptroller of the Currency in the manner prescribed in subsection
(e) of this section, and any State nonmember bank, upon application
to and examination by the Corporation and approval by the board of
directors, may become an insured bank. Before approving the appli-
cation of any such State nonmember bank, the board of directors
shall give consideration to the factors enumerated in subsection (g
of this section and shall determine, upon the basis of a thoroug
examination of such bank, that its assets in excess of its capital
requirements are adequate to enable it to meet all its liabilities to
depositors and other creditors as shown by the books of the bank.

“(g) The factors to be enumerated in the certificate required under
subsection (e) and to be considered by the board of directors under
subsection (f) shall be the following: The financial history and con-
dition of the bank, the adequacy of its capital structure, its future
earnings prospects, the general character of its management, the con-
venience and needs of the community to be served by the bank, and
whether or not its corporate powers are consistent with the purposes
of this section.

“(h) (1) The assessment rate shall be one-twelfth of 1 per centum
er annum. The semiannual assessment for each insured bank shall
e in the amount of the product of one-half the annual assessment

rate multiplied by an assessment base which shall be the average for
six months of the differences at the end of each calendar day between
the total amount of liability of the bank for deposits (according to
the definition of the term * deposit’ in and pursuant to paragraph
(12) of subsection (c) of this section, without any deduction for
indebtedness of depositors) and the total of such uncollected items as
are included in such deposits and credited subject to final payment:
Provided, however, That the daily total of such uncollected items
shall be determined according to regulations prescribed by the board
of directors upon a consideration of the factors of general usage and
ordinary time of availability, and for the purposes of such deduction
no item shall be regarded as uncollected for longer periods than those
prescribed by such regulations. Each insured bank shall, as a condi-

6 [Pups. 305.)

tion to the right to deduct any specific uncollected item in determin-
ing its assessment base, maintain such records as will readily permit
verification of the correctness of the particular deduction claimed.
The certified statements required to be filed with the Corporation
under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection shall be in such
form and set forth such ‘supporting information as the board of
directors shall prescribe. The assessment payments required from
insured banks under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection
shall be made in such manner and at such time or times as the board
of directors shall prescribe, provided the time or times so prescribed
shall not be later than sixty days after filing the certified statement
setting forth the amount of the assessment. "tn the event that a sepa-
rate Fund For Mutuals is established as provided in subsection (1),
the board of directors from time to time may fix a lower assessment,
rate operative for such period as the board may determine which
shall be applicable to insured mutual savings banks only, and the
remainder of this paragraph shall not be applicable to such banks.

“(2) On or before the 15th day of July of each year, each insured
bank shall file with the Corporation a certified statement under oath
showing for the six months ending on the preceding June 30 the
amount of the assessment base and the amount of the semiannual
assessment due to the Corporation, determined in accordance with
‘paragraph (1) of this subsection. Each insured bank shall pay to
the Corporation the amount of the semiannual assessment it is
required to certify. On or before the 15th day of January of each
year after 1936 each insured bank shall file with the Corporation a
similar certified statement for the six months ending on the preceding
December 81 and shall pay to the Corporation the amount of the
semiannual assessment it is required to certify.

“(3) Each bank which becomes an insured bank according to the
provisions of subsection (e) or (f) of this section shall, on or before
the 15th day of November 1935, file with the Corporation a certified
statement under oath showing the amount of the assessment due to
the Corporation for the period ending December 31, 1935, which shall
be an amount equal to the product of one-third the annual assess-
ment rate multiplied by the assessment base determined in accord-
ance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the assess-
ment base shall be the average for the 31 days in the month of
October 1935, and payment shall be made to the Corporation of the
amount of the assessment so required to be certified. Each such
bank shall, on or before the 15th day of January 1936, file with the
Corporation a certified statement under oath showin the amount
of the semiannual assessment due to the Corporation for the period
ending June 30, 1936, which shall be an amount equal to the product
of one-half the annual assessment rate multiplied by the assessment
base determined in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection
except that the assessment base shall be the average for the days of
the months of October, November and December of 1935, and pay-
ment shall be made to the Corporation of the amount of the assess-
ment so required to be certified.

“(4) Each bank which becomes an insured bank after the effective
date shall be relieved from complying with the provisions of para-
graph (2) of this subsection until it has operated as.an insured bank

for a full semiannual period ending on June 30 or December 31 as
the case may be. Fach such bank, on or before the forty-fifth day
after its first day of operation as an insured bank, shall file with the
Corporation its first certified statement which shall be under oath
and shall show the amount of the assessment base determined in
accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the
assessment base shall be the average for the first thirty-one calendar
days it operates as an insured bank. Each such certified statement
shall also show as the amount of the first assessment due to the Cor-
poration the prorated portion (for the period between its first day
of operation as an insured bank and the next succeeding last day of
June or December, as the case may be) of an amount equal to the
product of one-half the annual assessment rate multiplied by the

ase required to be set forth on its first certified statement. Each
bank which becomes an insured bank after the effective date which
has not operated as an insured bank for a full semiannual period
ending on June 30 or December 31, as the case may be, shall, on or
before the 15th day of the first month thereafter (except that banks
becoming insured in June or December shall have thirty-one addi-
tional days) file with the Corporation its second certified statement
under oath showing the amount of the assessment base and the amount
of the semiannual assessment due to the Corporation. Such assess-
ment base and amount shall be determined in accordance with para-
graph (1) of this subsection, except that if the bank became an
insured bank in the month of December or June the assessment base
shall be the average for the first thirty-one calendar days it operates
as an insured bank. and except that if it became an insured bank in
any other month than December or June the assessment base shall be
the average for the days between its first day of operation as an
insured bank and the next succeeding last day of June or December,
as the case may be. Each bank required to file a certified statement
under this paragraph shall pay to the Corporation the amount of the
assessment the bank is required to certify.

“(5) Each bank which shall be and continue without application
or approval an insured bank in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (e) or (f) of this section, shall, in lieu of all right to
refund (except as authorized in paragraph (3) of subsection. {i)),
be credited with any balance to which such bank shall become entitled
upon the termination of the said Temporary Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Fund or the Fund For Mutuals. The credit shall be applied
by the Corporation toward the payment of the assessment next
becoming due from such bank and upon succeeding assessments until
the credit is exhausted.

“(6) Any insured bank which fails to file any certified statement
required to be filed by it in connection with determining the amount
of any assessment payable by the bank to the Corporation may be
compelled to file such statement by mandatory injunction or other
appropriate remedy in a suit brought for such purpose by the Cor-
poration against the bank and any officer or officers thereof in any
court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district
or territory in which such bank is located.

“(7) The Corporation, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any
court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any
insured bank the amount of any unpaid assessment lawfully payable

20366 O—58—— 46

8 (Pus. 308.1

by such insured bank to the Corporation, whether or not such bank
shall have filed any such certified statement and whether or not suit
shall have been brought to compel the bank to file any such statement.

“(8) Should any national member bank or any insured national
nonmember bank fail to file any certified statement required to be
filed by such bank under any provision of this subsection, or fail to
pay any assessment required to be paid by such bank under any ro-
vision of this section, and should the bank not correct such failure
within thirty days after written notice has been given by the Corpo-
ration to an officer of the bank, citing this paragraph, and stating
that the bank has failed to file or pay as required by law, all the
rights,. privileges, and franchises of the bank granted to it under the
National Bank Act or under the provisions of this Act, as amended,
shall be thereby forfeited. Whether or not the penalty provided in
this paragraph has been incurred shall be determined and adjudged
in the manner provided in the sixth paragraph of section 2 of this
Act, as amended. The remedies provided in this paragraph and in
the two preceding paragraphs shall not be construed as Limiting any
other remedies against any insured bank, but shall be in addition
thereto.

“(9) Trust funds held by an insured bank in a fiduciary capacity
whether held in its trust or deposited in any other department or in
another bank shall be insured in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for
each trust estate, and when deposited by the fiduciary bank in another
insured bank such trust funds shall be similarly insured to the fidu-
ciary bank according to the trust estates represented. Notwithstand-
ing any other provision of this section, such insurance shall be
separate from and additional to that covering other deposits of the
owners of such trust funds or the beneficiaries of such trust estates:
Provided, That where the fiduciary bank deposits any of such trust
funds in other insured banks, the amount so held by other insured
banks on deposit shall not for the purpose of any certified statement
required under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection be con-
sidered to be a deposit liability of the fiduciary bank, but shall be
considered to be a deposit liability of the bank in which such funds
are so deposited by such fiduciary bank. The board of directors
shall have power by regulation to prescribe the manner of reporting
and. of depositing such trust funds.

“() a) Any insured bank (except a national member bank or
State member bank) may, upon not less than ninety days’ written
notice to the Corporation, and to the Reconstruction Finance Cor-
poration if it owns or holds as pledgee any preferred stock, capital
notes, or debentures of such bank, terminate its status as an insured
bank. Whenever the board of directors shall find that an insured
bank or its directors or trustees have continued unsafe or unsound
practices in conducting the business of such bank, or have knowingly
or negligently permitted any of its officers or agents to violate any
provision of any law or regulation to which the insured bank is
subject, the board of directors shall first give to the Comptroller of
the Currency in the case of a national bank or a District bank, to the
authority having supervision of the bank in the case of a State bank,
or to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the
case of a State member bank, a statement with respect to such prac-

[Pup. 305.] 9

tices or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof.
Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty
days or such shorter period of time as the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency, the State authority, or Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, as the case may be, shall require, the board of direc-
tors, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the bank
not less than thirty days’ written notice of intention to terminate
the status of the bank as an insured bank, and shall fix a time and
place for a hearing before the board of directors or before a person
designated by it to conduct such hearing, at which evidence may be
produced, and upon such evidence the board of directors shall make
written findings which shall be conclusive. Unless the bank shall
appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall
be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an
insured bank. If the board of directors shall find that any violation
specified in such notice has been established, the board of directors
may order that the insured status of the bank be terminated on a
date subsequent to such finding and to the expiration of the time
specified in such notice of intention. The Corporation may publish
notice of such termination and the bank shall give notice of such
termination to each of its depositors at his last address of record on
the books of the bank, in such manner and. at such time as the board
of directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protec-
tion of depositors. After the termination of the insured status of
any bank under the provisions of this paragraph, the insured deposits
of each depositor in the bank on the date of such termination, less all
subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall
continue for a period of two years to be insured, and the bank shall
continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an
insured bank during such period. No additions to any such deposits
and no new deposits in such bank made after the date of such termi-
nation shall be insured by the Corporation, and the bank shall not
advertise or held itself out as having insured deposits unless in the
same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such
additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not
so insured. Such bank shall, in all other respects, be subject to the
duties and obligations of an insured bank for the period of two years
from the date of such termination, and in the event that such bank
shal] be closed on account of inability to meet the demands of its
depositors within such. period of two years, the Corporation shall
have the same powers and rights with respect to such bank as in
case of an insured bank.

“(2) Whenever the insured status of a State member bank shall be
terminated by action of the board of directors, the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System shall terminate its membership
in the Federal Reserve System in accordance with the provisions of
section 9 of this Act, and. whenever the insured status of a national
member bank shall be so terminated the Comptroller of the Currency
shall appoint a receiver for the bank, which shall be the Corporation
whenever the bank shall be unable to meet the demands of its
depositors. Whenever a member bank shall cease to be a member
of the Federal Reserve System, its status as an insured bank shall,

10 [Pua. 206]

without notice or other action by the board of directors, terminate on
the date the bank shall cease to be a member of the Federal Reserve
System, with like effect as if its insured status had been terminated
on said date by the board of dizectors after proceedings under para-
graph (1) of this subsection.

“(3) If any nonmember bank which becomes an insured bank
under the provisions of. paragraph (1) of subsection (f) of this sec-
tion shall elect, within thirty days after the effective date, not to
continue as an insured bank, and shall within such period give writ-
ten notice to the Corporation of its election, in accordance with regu-
lations to be prescribed by the board of directors, and to the Recon-
struction Finance Corporation if it owns or holds as pledgee an
preferred stock, capital notes, or debentures of such bank, it sha
cease to be an insured bank and cease to be subject to the provisions
of this section and the rights of the bank (including its right to any
refund) shall be as provided by law existing prior. to the effective
date. The board of directors shall cause notice of termination of
insurance to be given to the depositors of such bank by publication
or otherwise as the board of directors may determine, and the deposits
in such bank shail continue to be insured for twenty days beyond
such thirty day period.

“(4) Whenever the liabilities of an insured bank for deposits shall
have been assumed by another insured bank or banks, the insured
status of the bank whose liabilities are so assumed shall terminate on
the date of receipt by the Corporation of satisfactory evidence of
such assumption with like effect as if its insured status had been ter-
minated on said date by the board of directors after proceedings
under paragraph (1) of this subsection: Provided, That if the banit
whose liabilities are so assumed gives to its depositors notice of such
assumption within thirty days after such assumption takes effect, by
publication or by any reasonable means, in accordance with regula-
tions to be prescribed by the board of directors, the insurance of its
deposits shall terminate at the end of six months from the date such
assumption takes effect, and such bank shall thereupon be relieved of
all future obligations to the Corporation, including the obligation to
pay future assessments.

“(j), Upon the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1933, the
Corporation shall become a body corporate and as such shall have

ower—

“First. To adopt and use a corporate seal.

“Second. To have succession until dissolved by an Act of Congress.

“Third. To make contracts.

“ Fourth. To sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court
of law or equity, State or Federal. All suits of a civil nature at
common law or in equity to which the Corporation shall be a party
shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States: Pro-
vided, That any such suit te which the Corporation is a party in its
capacity as receiver of a State bank and which involves only the
rights or obligations of depositors, creditors, stockholders and such
State bank under State law shall not be deemed to arise under the
laws of the United States. No attachment or execution shall be
issued against the Corporation or its property before final judgment
in any suit, action, or proceeding in any State, county, municipal, or

[Pus. 306] 11

United States court. The board vf directors shall designate an agent
upon whom service of process may be made in any State, Territory,
or jurisdiction in which any insured bank is located.

“Fifth. To appoimt by its board of directors such officers and
employees as are not otherwise provided for in this section, to define
their duties, fix their compensation, require bonds of them and fix
the penalty thereof, and to dismiss at pleasure such officers or
employees. Nothing in this or any other Act shall be construed to
prevent the appointment and compensation as an officer or employee
of the Corporation of any officer or employee of the United States in

Corporation for the uses and purposes of the Corporation: Provided,
That the obligations to and rights of the Corporation, depositors,
banks, and other persons arising out of any event or transaction
prior to the effective date shall remain unimpaired. On and after
the effective date, the Corporation shall insure the deposits of all
insured banks as provided in this section: Provided, That the insur-
ance shall apply only to deposits of insured banks which have been
made available since March 10, 1933, for withdrawal in the usual
course of the banking business: Provided further, That if any insured
bank shall, without the consent of the Corporation, release or modify
restrictions on or deferments of deposits which had not been made
available for withdrawal in the usual course of the banking business

“(2) For the purposes of this section, an insured bank shall be
deemed to have been closed on account of inability to meet the
demands of its depositors in any case in which it has been closed for
the purpose of liquidation without adequate provision being made
for payment of its depositors.

“(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever any
insured national bank or insured District bank shall have been closed
by action of its board of directors, or by the Comptroller of the
Currency, as the case may be, on account of inability to meet the
demands of its depositors, the Comptroller of the Currency shall
appoint the Corporation receiver for such closed bank, and no other
person shall be appointed as receiver of such closed bank.

“(4) It shall be the duty of the Corporation as such receiver to
realize upon the assets of such closed bank, having due regard to the
condition of credit in the locality; to enforce the individual liability
of the stockholders and directors thereof; and to wind up the affairs
of such closed bank in conformity with the provisions of law relating
to the liquidation of closed national banks, except as herein other-
wise provided. The Corporation shall retain for its own account
such portion of the amounts realized from such liquidation as it shall
be entitled to receive on account of its subrogation to the claims of
depositors, and it shall pay to depositors and other creditors the net
amounts available for distribution to them. With respect to any
such closed bank, the Corporation as such receiver shall have all the
rights, powers, and privileges now possessed by or hereafter granted

law to a receiver of an insolvent national bank.

“(5) Whenever any insured State bank (except a District bank)
shall have been closed by action of its board of directors or by the
authority having supervision of such bank, as the case may be,
on account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, the
Corporation shall accept appoimtment as receiver thereof, if such
appointment is tendered by the authority having supervision of such
bank and is authorized or permitted by State law. With respect to
any such insured State bank, the Corporation as such receiver shall
possess all the rights, powers and privileges granted by State law to
a receiver of a State bank.

“(6) Whenever an insured bank shall have been closed on account
of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, payment of the
insured deposits in such bank shall be made by the Corporation as
soon as possible, subject to the provisions of paragraph (7) of this
subsection, either (A) by making available to each depositor a
transferred deposit in a new bank in the same community or in
another insured bank in an amount equal to the insured deposit of
such depositor and subject to withdrawal on demand, or (B) in such
other manner as the board of directors may prescribe: Provided,
That the Corporation, in its discretion, may require proof of claims
to be filed before paying the insured deposits, and that in any case
where the Corporation is not satisfied as to the validity of a claim
for an insured deposit, it may require the final determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction before paying such claim.

“(7) In the case of a closed national bank or District bank, the
Corporation, upon the payment of any depositor as provided in para-

aph (6) of this subsection, shall be subrogated to all rights of the
depositor against the closed bank to the extent of such payment.

14 [Pus. 305.]

In the case of any other closed insured bank, the Corporation shall
not make any payment to any depositor until the right of the Corpo-
ration to be subrogated to the rights of such depositor on the same
basis as provided in the case of a closed national bank under this
section shall have been recognized either by express provision of
State law, by allowance of claims by the authority having super-
vision of such bank, by assignment of claims by depositors, or by
any other effective method. ‘In the case of any closed insured bank,
such subrogation shall include the right on the part of the Corpora-
tion to receive the same dividends from the proceeds of the assets of
such closed bank and recoveries on account of stockholders’ liability
as would have been payable to the depositor on a claim for the
insured deposit, but such depositor shall retain his claim for any
uninsured portion of his deposit: Provided, That the rights of
depositors and other creditors of any State bank shall be determined
in accordance with the applicable provisions of State law.

“(8) As soon as possible after the closing of an insured bank, the
Corporation, if it finds that it is advisable and in the interest of the
depositors of the closed bank or the public, shall organize a new
national bank to assume the insured deposits of such closed bank and
otherwise to perform temporarily the functions hereinafter provided
for. The new bank shall have its place of business in the same
community as the closed bank.

“(9) The articles of association and the organization certificate of
the new bank shall be executed by representatives designated by the
Corporation. No capital stock need be paid in by the Corporation.
The new bank shall not have a board of directors, but shall be man-
aged by an executive officer appointed by the board of directors of
the Corporation who shall be subject to its directions. In all other
respects the new bank shall be organized in accordance with the then
existing provisions of law relating to the organization of national
banking associations. The new bank may, with the approval of the
Corporation, accept new deposits which shall be subject to with-
drawal on demand and which, except where the new bank is the
only bank in the community, shall not exceed $5,000 from any depos-
itor. The new bank, without application to or approval by the
Corporation, shall be an insured bank and shall maintain on deposit
with the Federal Reserve bank of its district reserves in the amount
required by law for member banks, but it shall not be required to
subscribe for stock of the Federal Reserve bank. Funds of the
new bank shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in obligations of
the United States, or in obligations guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the United States, or deposited with the Corporation,
with a Federal Reserve bank, or, to the extent of the insurance
coverage thereon, with an insured bank. The new bank, unless other-
wise authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency, shall transact
no business except that authorized by this section and as may be
incidental to its organization. Notwithstanding any other provision
of law the new bank, its franchise, property, and income shall be
exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United
States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any
State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority.

[Pus. 305.) 15

“(10) Upon the organization of a new bank, the Corporation shall

romptly make available to it an amount equal to the estimated
insured deposits of such closed bank plus the estimated amount of
the expenses of operating the new bank, and shall determine as soon
as possible the amount due each depositor for his insured deposit
in the closed bank, and the total expenses of operation of the new
bank. Upon such determination, the amounts so estimated and made
available shall be adjusted to conform to the amounts so determined.
Earnings of the new bank shall be paid over or credited to the
Corporation in such adjustment. If any new bank, during the period
it continues its status as such, sustains any losses with respect to
which it is not effectively protected except by reason of being an
insured bank, the Corporation shall furnish to it additional funds
in the amount of such losses. The new bank shall assume as trans-
ferred deposits the payment of the insured deposits of such closed
bank to each of it* depositors. Of the amounts so made available, the
Corporation shall transfer to the new bank, in cash, such sums as may
be necessary to enable it to meet its expenses of operation and imme-
diate cash demands on such transferred deposits, and the remainder
of such amounts shall be subject to withdrawal by the new bank on
demand.

“(11) Whenever in the judgment of the board of directors it is
desirable to do so, the Corporation shall cause capital stock of the
new bank to be offered for sale on such terms and conditions as the
board of directors shall deem advisable in an amount sufficient, in the
opinion of the board of directors, to make possible the conduct of the
business of the new bank on a sound basis, but in no event less than
that required by section 5138 of the Revised Statutes, as amended
(U. 8. C., Supp. VIT, title 12, sec. 51), for the organization of a
national bank in the place where such new bank is located. The
stockholders of the closed insured bank shall be given the first oppor-
tunity to purchase any shares of common stock so offered. Upon
prook that an adequate amount of capital stock in the new bank has

een subscribed and paid for in cash, the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency shall require the articles of association and the organization
certificate to be amended to conform to the requirements for the
organization of a national bank, and thereafter, when the require-
ments of law with respect to the organization of a national bank have
been complied with, he shall issue to the bank a certificate of author-
ity to commence business, and thereupon the bank shall cease to have
the status of a new bank, shall be managed by directors elected by its
own shareholders and may exercise all the powers granted by jaw
and it shall be subject to all the provisions of law relating to national
banks. Such bank shall thereafter be an insured national bank, with-
out certification to or approval by the Corporation.

“(12) If the capital stock of the new bank is not offered for sale,
or if an adequate amount of capital for such new bank is not sub-
scribed and paid for, the board of directors may offer to transfer its
business to any insured bank-in the same community which will take
over its assets, assume its liabilities, and pay to the Corporation for
such business such amount as the board of directors may deem ade-
quate; or the board of directors in its discretion may change the
location of the new bank to the office of the Corporation or to some
other place or may at any time wind up its affairs as herein provided.

1So in original.

16 [Pus. 9084

Unless the capital stock of the new bank is sold or its assets are taken
over and its liabilities are assumed by an insured bank as above pro-
vided within two years from the date of its organization, the Corpo-
ration shali wind up the affairs of such bank, after giving such notice.
if any, as the Comptroller of the Currency may require, and sha
certify to the Comptroller of the Currency. the termination of the
new bank. Thereafter the Corporation shall be liable for the obli-
gations of such bank and shall be the owner of its assets. The provi-
sions of sections 5220 and 5221 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. C., title
12, secs. 181 and 182) shall not apply to such new banks.

or District bank shall not be required to furnish bond and shall have
the right to appoint an agent or agents to assist it in its duties as
such receiver, and all fees, compensation, and expenses of liquidation
and administration thereof shall be fixed by the Corporation, subject
to the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, and may be paid
by it out of funds coming into its possession as such receiver. The
Comptroller of the Currency is authorized and empowered to waive
and relieve the Corporation from complying with any regulations of
the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to receiverships where
in his discretion such action isedeemed advisable to simplify admin-
istration.

“(2) Payment of an insured deposit to any person by the Corpora-
tion shall discharge the Corporation, and payment of a transferred
deposit to any person by the new bank or by an insured bank in which
a transferred deposit has been made available shall discharge the
Corporation and such new bank or other insured bank, to the same
extent that payment to such person by the closed bank would have
discharged it from liability for the insured deposit.

“(3) Except as otherwise prescribed by the board of directors,
neither the Corporation nor such new. bank or other insured bank
shall be required to recognize as the owner of any portion of a deposit
appearing on the records of the closed bank under a name other than
that of the claimant, any person whose name or interest as such owner _
is not. disclosed on the records of such closed bank as part owner of ©
said deposit, if such recognition would increase the aggregate amount
of the insured deposits in such closed bank.

“(4) The Corporation may withhold payment of such portion of
the insured deposit of any depositor in a closed bank as may be
required to provide for the payment of any liability of such deposi-
tor as a stockholder of the closed bank, or of any lability of such
‘depositor to the closed bank or its receiver, which is not offset against
a claim due from such bank, pending the determination and payment
of such liability by such depositor or any other person liable therefor.

“(5) If, after the Corporation shall have given at least three
months’ notice to the depositor by mailing a copy thereof to his last
known address appearing on the records of the closed bank, any
depositor in the closed bank shall fail to claim his insured deposit
from the Corporation within eighteen months after the appoint-
ment of the receiver for the closed bank, or shall fail within such
period to clainf or arrange to continue the transferred deposit with
the new bank or with the other insured bank which assumes liabilit
therefor, all rights of the depositor against the Corporation with

[Pus. 305.] 17

respect to the insured deposit, and against the new bank and such
other insured bank with respect to the transferred deposit, shall be
barred, and all rights of the depositor against the closed bank and its
shareholders, or the receivership estate to which the Corporation may
have become subrogated, shall thereupon revert to the depositor.
The amount of any transferred deposits not claimed within such
eighteen months’ period, shall be refunded to the Corporation.

‘““(n) (1) Money of the Corporation not otherwise employed shall
be invested in obligations of the United States or in obligations
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, except
that for temporary periods, in the discretion of the board of direc-
tors, funds of the Corporation may be deposited in any Federal
Reserve bank or with the Treasurer of the United States. When
designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Corporation shall be a depositary of public moneys, except receipts
from customs, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the
said Secretary, and may also be employed as a financial agent of
the Government. Jt shall perform all such reasonable duties as
depositary of public moneys and financial agent of the Government
as may be required of it.

“(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to pre-
vent the Corporation from making loans to national banks closed by
action of the Comptroller of the Currency, or by vote of their direc-
tors, or to State member banks closed by action of the appropriate
State authorities, or by vote of their directors, or from entering into
negotiations to secure the reopening of such banks.

“(3) Receivers or liquidators of insured banks closed on account of
inability to meet the demands of their depositors shall be entitled
to offer the assets of such banks for sale to the Corporation or as
security for loans from the Corporation, upon receiving permission
from the appropriate State authority in accordance with express
provisions of State law in the case of insured State banks, or from
the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks or
District banks. The proceeds of every such sale or loan shall be
utilized for the same purposes and in the same manner as other funds
realized from the liquidation of the assets of such banks. The Comp-
troller of the Currency may, in his discretion, pay dividends on
proved claims at any time after the expiration of the period of adver-
tisement made pursuant to section 5235 of the Revised Statutes
(U. S. C., title 12, sec. 193), and no liability shall attach to the
Comptroller of the Currency or to the receiver of any national bank
by reason of any such payment for failure to pay dividends to a
claimant whose claim is not proved at the time of any such payment.
The Corporation, in its discretion, may make loans on the security
of or may purchase and liquidate or sell any part of the assets of
an insured bank which is now or may hereafter be closed on account
of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, but in any case
in which the Corporation is acting as receiver of a closed insured
bank, no such loan or purchase shall be made without the approval
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

“(4) Until July 1, 1936, whenever in the judgment of the board of
directors such action will reduce the risk or avert a threatened loss to
the Corporation and will facilitate a merger or consolidation of an
18 [Pus. 308]

insured bank with another insured bank, or will facilitate the sale of
the assets of an open or closed insured bank to and assumption of its
liabilities by another insured bank, the Corporation may, upon such
terms and conditions as it may determine, make loans secured in
whole or in part by assets of an open or closed insured bank, which
loans may be in subordination to the rights of depositors and other
creditors, or the Corporation may purchase any such assets or may
guarantee any other insured bank against loss by reason of its
assuming the liabilities and purchasing the assets of an open or closed
insured bank. Any insured national bank or District bank, or, with
the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, any receiver
thereof, is authorized to contract for such sales or loans and to pledge
any assets of the bank to secure such loans.

“(o) (1) The Corporation is authorized and empowered to issue
and to have outstanding its notes, debentures, bonds, or other such
obligations, in a par amount aggregating not more than three times

amended, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under
the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, are extended to include
such purchases: Provided, That if the Reconstruction Finance. Cor-
poration fails for any reason to purchase any of the obligations. of

tions In an amount equal to the amount of such obligations the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation so fails to purchase: Provided
further, That the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and
directed, whenever in the judgment of the board of directors of the
Corporation additional funds are required for insurance purposes, to

ered in granting or withholding the consent of the Corporation under
this paragraph shall be those enumerated in subsection (g) of this
section.

“(6) The Corporation may require any insured bank to provide
protection and indemnity against burglary, defalcation, and other
similar insurable losses. Whenever any insured bank refuses to
comply with any such requirement the Corporation may contract
for such protection and indemnity and add the cost thereof to the
assessment otherwise payable by such bank.

“(7) Whenever any insured bank (except a national bank or a
District bank), after written notice of the recommendations of the
Corporation based on a report of examination of such bank by an
examiner of the Corporation, sl.all fail to comply with such recom-
mendations within one hundred and twenty days after such notice,
the Corporation shall have the power, and is hereby authorized, to
publish only such part of such report of examination as relates to
any recommendation not complied with: Provided, That notice of
intention to make such publication shall be given to the bank at
least ninety days before such publication is made.

“(8) The board of directors shall by regulation prohibit the pay-
ment of interest on demand deposits in insured nonmember banks and
for such purpose it may define the term ‘ demand deposits’; but such
exceptions from this prohibition shall be made as are now or may
hereafter be prescribed with respect to deposits payable on demand
in member banks by section 19 of this Act, as amended, or by regula-
tion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The
board of directors shall from time to time limit by regulation the
rates of interest or dividends which may be paid by insured non-
member banks on time and savings deposits, but such regulations
shall be consistent with the contractual obligations of such banks to
their depositors. For the purpose of fixing such rates of interest or
dividends, the board of directors shall by regulation prescribe
different rates for such payment on time and savings deposits having
different maturities, or subject to different conditions respecting with-
drawal or repayment, or subject to different conditions by reason of
different locations, or according to the varying discount rates of
member banks mm the several Federal Reserve districts. The board
of directors shall by regulation define what constitutes time and
savings deposits in an insured nonmember bank. Such regulations
shall prohibit any insured nonmember bank from paying any time
deposit before its maturity except upon such conditions and in
22 [Pus. 305.]

accordance with such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the board of directors, and from waiving any requirement of notice
before payment of any savings deposit except as to all savings
deposits having the same requirement. For each violation of any
provision of this paragraph or any lawful provision of such regula-
tions relating to the payment of interest or dividends on deposits or
to. withdrawal of deposits, the offending bank shall be subject to a
penalty or‘ not more than $100, recoverable by the Corporation for
its use.

“(w) The provisions of sections 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, and 117 of
the Criminal Code of the United States (U.S. G., title 18, ch. 5, secs.
202 to 207, inclusive), insofar as applicable, are extended to apply to
contracts or agreements with the Corporation under this section,
which for the purposes hereof shall be held to include loans, advances,
extensions, and renewals thereof, and acceptances, releases, and sub-
stitutions of security therefor, purchases or sales of assets, and all
contracts and agreements pertaining to the same.

“(x) The Secret Service Division of the Treasury Department is
authorized to detect, arrest, and deliver into the custody of the United
States marshal having jurisdiction any person committing any of
the offenses punishable under this section.

“(y) (1) No State bank which during the calendar year 1941 or any
succeeding calendar year shall have average deposits of $1,000,000
or more shall be an insured bank or continue to have any part of its
deposits insured after July 1 of the year following any such calendar
year during which it shall have had such amount of average deposits,
unless such bank shall be a member of the Federal Reserve System:
Provided, That for the purposes of this paragraph the term ‘ State
bank’ shall not include a savings bank, a mutual savings bank, a
Morris Plan bank or other incorporated banking institution engaged
only in a business similar to that transacted by Morris Plan banks,
a State trust company doing no commercial banking business, or a
bank located in Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.

“(2) It is not the purpose of this section to discriminate, in any
manner, against State nonmember, and in favor of, national or
member banks; but the purpose is to provide all banks with the
same opportunity to obtain and enjoy the benefits of this section.
No bank shall be discriminated against because its capital stock is less
than the amount required for eligibility for admission into the
Federal Reserve System.

“(z) The provisions of this section limiting the insurance of the
deposits of any depositor to a maximum less than the full amount
shall be independent and separable from each and ali of the provisions
of this section.”
