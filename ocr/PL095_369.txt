“(2) After any branch of a foreign bank becomes an insured branch,
the bank shall maintain on i with the Corporation, or as the
Corporation may direct, surety bonds or assets or both, in such amounts
and of such types as shall be determined from time to time in accord-
ance with such regulations as the Board of Directors may prescribe.
Such regulations may impose differin uirements on the basis of

sonably related to the purpose set forth in paragraph (4).

“(3) The Corporation may ana of any given bank larger deposits
of bonds and assets than required under paragraph (2) of this subsec-
tion if, in the judgment of the Corporation, the situation of that bank
or any branch thereof is or becomes such that the deposits of bonds
and assets otherwise required under this section would not adequately
fulfill the purpose set forth in paragraph (4). The imposition of any
such additional requirements may be without notice or opportunity for
hearing, but $s Corputetion shall afford an cepeetaniny to any such
bank to apply for a reduction or removal of any such additional

irements so imposed.

fund against the risks entailed in insuring the domestic deposits of a
foreign bank whose activities, assets, and personnel are in large part
outside the jurisdiction of the United States, In the implementation
of its authority under this subsection, however, the Corporation shall
endeavor to avoid imposing requirements on such banks which would

domestically incorporated banks. ~

“(5) In the case of any failure or threatened failure of a foreign
bank to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection
(c), the Corporation, in addition to all other administrative and judi-
cial remedies, may apply to any United States district court, or United
States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which an
branch of the bank is located, for an injunction to compel such b:
and any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or any other person having
custody or control of any of its assets, to deliver to the Corporation
such assets as may be necessary to meet such requirement, and to take
any other action necessary to vest the Corporation with control of
assets so delivered. If the court shall determine that there has been
any such failure or threatened failure to comply with any such require-
ment, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction. The
propriety of the requirement may be ce a ig only as provided in
chapter 7 of title 5 of the United States e, and may not be made
an issue in an action for an injunction under this paragraph.”.

Sec. 7. (a)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this
subsection, subsections (a), (b), (ec), (a), (f), (gz), (i), cj), ck), and
the second sentence of subsection (e) of section 19 of the Federal
Reserve Act shall apply to every Federal branch and Federal agency of
a foreign bank in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
Federal branch or Federal agency were a member bank as that term is
defined in section 1 of the Federal Reserve Act; but the Board either
by general or specific regulation or ruling may waive the minimum
and maximum reserve ratios  papaecipet under section 19 of the Federal
Reserve Act and may prescribe any ratio, not more than 22 per centum,
for any obligation of any such Federal branch or Federal agency that
the Board may deem reasonable and appropriate, taking into con-
sideration the character of business conducted by such institutions and
the need to maintain vigorous and fair competition between and among
such institutions and member banks. The Board may impose reserve
requirements on Federal branches and Federal agencies in such grad-
uated manner as it deems reasonable and appropriate.

(B) After consultation and in cooperation with the State bank
supervisory authorities, the Board may make applicable to any State
branch or State agency any requirement made applicable to, or which
the Board has anthorit to impose upon, any Federal branch or agency
under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

(2) A branch or agency shall be subject to this subsection only if
(A) its parent foreign bank has total worldwide consolidated bank
assets in excess of $1,000,000,000; (B) its parent foreign bank is con-
trolled by a foreign company which owns or controls foreign banks

the end thereof the following new paragraph :

“Subject. to such restrictions, limitations, and regulations as may
be imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
each Federal Reserve bank may receive deposits from, discount paper
endorsed by, and make advances to any branch or agency of a fore
bank in the same manner and to the same extent that it may exercise
such powers with respect to a member bank if such branch or agenc
is maintaining reserves with such Reserve bank pursuant to section
of the International Banking Act of 1978. In exercising any such
poner with respect to any such branch or agency, each Federal

rve bank shall give due regard to account balances being main-
tained by such branch or agency with such Reserve bank and the pro-
portion of the assets of such branch or agency being held as reserves
under section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978. For the
urposes of this paragraph, the terms ‘branch’, agency’, and ‘foreign
Ba ’ shall have the same meanings assigned to them in section 1 of
the International Banking Act of 1978.”.

(c) (1) The Board may make examinations of each branch or agen
of a foreign bank, and of each commercial lending company or ban
controlled pd one or more foreign banks or by one or more forei
companies that control a foreign bank, the cost of which shall

case may be. The Board shall, insofar as possible, use the reports of
examinations made by the Comptroller, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, or the appropriate State bank supervisory authority for
the pur of this su ion.

(2) Each branch or agency of a foreign bank, other than a Federal
branch or agency, shall be subject to paragraph 20 and the provision
requiring the reports of condition contained in paragraph 6 of sec-
tion 9 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 335 and 324) to the
same extent and in the same manner as if the branch or agency were
a State member bank. In addition to any requirements imposed under
section 4 of this Act, each Federal branch and agency shall be subject
to subparagraph (a) of section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (12
U.S.C. 248(a)) and to paragraph 5 of section 21 of the Federal
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 483) to the same extent and in the same
manner as if it were a member bank.

(d) On or before two years after enactment of this Act, the Board
after consultation with the appropriate State bank superviso
authorities shall report to the Committee on Banking, Finance an
Urban Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and
the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban A ffairs of the United
States Senate its recommendations with respect to the implementation
of this Act, including any recommended requirements such as limita-
tions on loans to affiliates or capital adequacy requirements which
should be imposed on foreign banks to carry out the purposes of this
Act. Not later than one hundred and eighty days after the enactment
of this Act, the Board shall report to such Committees the steps
which have been taken to consult and cooperate with State bank

of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and to sections 105 and
106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 in the
same manner and to the same extent that bank holding companies
are subject thereto, except that any such foreign bank or company
shall not by reason of this subsection be deemed a bank holding
company for purposes of section 3 of the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956.

(b) Until December 31, 1985, a foreign bank or other company
to which subsection (a) applies on the date of enactment of this Act

conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices in the United States.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a foreign bank or com-
pany referred to in this subsection (c) may retain ownership or con-
trol of any voting shares (or, where necessary to prevent dilution of its
voting interest, acquire additional voting shares) of any domestically-

in or the assets of a going concern engaged in such activities. Any for-
eign bank or company that is authorized to engage in any activity pur-
suant to this subsection (c) but, as a result of action of the Board, is

does not own or control, directly or indirectly, 25 per centum or more of
its voting shares.

agency of a foreign bank or a commercial lending company controlled
by a foreign bank or foreign company that controls a foreign bank asa
“bank” for the purposes of any provisions of the Bank Holding Com-

any Act of 1956, or section 105 of the Bank Holding Company Act
iinaidments of 1970, except that any such branch, ce: or com-
mercial lending company subsidiary shall be deemed a “bank” or
“banking subsidiary”, as the case may be, for the purposes of applying
the prohibitions of section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act
Amendments of 1970 and the exemptions provided in sections 4(¢) (1),
4(c) (2), 13 &), and 4(c) (4) of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843(c) (1), (2), (3), and (4)) to any foreign bank
or other company to which subsection (a) applies.

(e) Section 2(h) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is
amended (1) by striking out “(h) The” and inserting in lieu thereof
“(h) (1) Except as provided by paragraph (2), the”, (2) by striking

related to the business of the investor company) that is principally
engaged in business outside the United States if such shares are held
or acquired by a bank holding company organized under the laws
of a foreign country that is principally oa ON in the banking busi-
ness outside the United States, mg that (1) such exempt foreign
company (A) may engage in or hold shares of a company en

ing or financial operations or types of activities permitted wee sec-
tion 4(c) (8) or in any order or regulation issued by the Board under
