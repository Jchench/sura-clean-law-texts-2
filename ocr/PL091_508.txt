APPENDIX TO PART 600—COMMENTARY ON THE
FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT

AUTHORITY: 15 U.S.C. 1681s and 16 CFR 1.73.

SOURCE: 55 FR 18808, May 4, 1990, unless
otherwise noted.

§600.1 Authority and purpose.

(a) Authority. This part is issued by
the Commission pursuant to the provi-
sions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Pub. L. 91-508, approved October 26,
1970. 84 Stat. 1127-86 (15 U.S.C. 1681 et
seq).

(b) Purpose. The purpose of this part
is to clarify and consolidate state-
ments of general policy or interpreta-
tions in a commentary in the appendix
to this part. The Commentary will
serve as guidance to consumer report-
ing agencies, their customers, and con-
sumer representatives. The Fair Credit
Reporting Act requires that the man-
ner in which consumer reporting agen-
cies provide information be fair and eq-
uitable to the consumer with regard to
the confidentiality, accuracy, and
proper use of such information. The
Commentary will enable interested
parties to resolve their questions more
easily, present a more comprehensive
treatment of interpretations and facili-
tate compliance with the Fair Credit
Reporting Act in accordance with Con-
gressional intent.

$600.2 Legal effect.

(a) The interpretations in the Com-
mentary are not trade regulation rules
or regulations, and, as provided in §1.73
of the Commission’s rules, they do not
have the force or effect of statutory
provisions.

(b) The regulations of the Commis-
sion relating to the administration of
the Fair Credit Reporting Act are
found in subpart H of 16 CFR part 1
(§§ 1.71-1.73).

APPENDIX TO PART 600—COMMENTARY
ON THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT

INTRODUCTION

1. Official status. This Commentary con-
tains interpretations of the Federal Trade
Commission (Commission) of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FCRA). It is a guideline in-
tended to clarify how the Commission will
construe the FCRA in light of Congressional
intent as reflected in the statute and its leg-
islative history. The Commentary does not
have the force or effect of regulations or
statutory provisions, and its contents may
be revised and updated as the Commission
considers necessary or appropriate.

2. Status of previous interpretations. The
Commentary primarily addresses issues dis-
cussed in the Commission’s earlier formal in-
terpretations of the FCRA (16 CFR 600.1-
600.8), which are hereby superseded, in the
staff's manual entitled “Compliance With the
Fair Credit Reporting Act” (the current edi-
tion of which was published in May 1978, and
revised in January 1977 and March 1979), and
in informal staff opinion letters responding
to public requests for interpretations, and it
also reflects the results of the Commission’s
FCRA enforcement program. It is intended
to synthesize the Commission’s views and
give clear advice on important issues. The
Commentary sets forth some interpretations
that differ from those previously expressed
by the Commission or its staff, and is in-
tended to supersede all prior formal Commis-
sion interpretations, informal staff opinion
letters, and the staff manual cited above.

3. Statutory references. Reference to several
different provisions of the FCRA is fre-
quently required in order to make a com-
plete analysis of an issue. For various sec-
tions and subsections of the FCRA, the Com-
mentary discusses the most important and
common overlapping references under the
heading “Relation to other (sub)sections.”

4, Issuance of staff interpretations. The Com-
mission will revise and update the Com-
mentary as it deems necessary, based on the
staff's experience in responding to public in-
quiries about, and enforcing, the FCRA. The
Commission welcomes input from interested
industry and consumer groups and other pub-
lic parties on the Commentary and on issues
discussed in it. Staff will continue to respond
to requests for informal staff interpreta-
tions. In proposing revisions of the Com-
mentary, staff will consider and, where ap-
propriate, recommend that the Commentary
incorporate issues raised in correspondence
and other public contacts, as well as in con-
nection with the Commission’s enforcement
efforts. Therefore, a party may raise an issue

546
Federal Trade Commission

for inclusion in future editions of the Com-
mentary without making any formal submis-
sion or request to that effect. However, re-
quests for formal Commission interpreta-
tions of the FCRA may also still be made
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
Commission’s Rules (16 CFR 1.78).

5. Commentary citations to FCRA. The Com-
mentary should be used in conjunction with
the text of the statute. In some cases, the
Commentary includes an abbreviated de-
scription of the statute, rather than the full
text, as a preamble to discussion of issues
pertaining to various sections and sub-
sections. These summary statements of the
law should not be used as a substitute for the
statutory text.

Section 601—Short Title

“This title may be cited as the Fair Credit
Reporting Act.”

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is
title VI of the Consumer Credit Protection
Act, which also includes other Federal stat-
utes relating to consumer credit, such as the
Truth in Lending Act (title I), the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act (Title VII), and the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (title
VIID.

Section 602—Findings and Purpose

Section 602 recites the Congressional find-
ings regarding the significant role of con-
sumer reporting agencies in the nation’s fi-
nancial system, and states that the basic
purpose of the FCRA is to require consumer
reporting agencies to adopt reasonable pro-
cedures for providing information to credit
grantors, insurers, employers and others ina
manner that is fair and equitable to the con-
sumer with regard to confidentiality, accu-
racy, and the proper use of such information.

Section 603—Definitions and Rules of
Construction

Section 603(a) states that “definitions and
rules of construction set forth in this section
are applicable for the purposes of this title.”

Section 603(b) defines person to mean “any
individual, partnership, corporation, trust,
estate, cooperative, association, government
or governmental subdivision or agency or
other entity.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

Certain “persons” must comply with the
Act. The term consumer reporting agency is
defined in section 608(f) to include certain
“persons.” Section 619 subjects any “person”
who knowingly and willfully obtains infor-
mation from a consumer reporting agency on
a consumer under false pretenses to criminal
sanctions. Requirements relating to report
users apply to “persons.” Section 606 imposes
disclosure obligations on “persons” who ob-
tain investigative reports or cause them to

Pt. 600, App.

be prepared. Section 615(c) uses the term per-
son to denote those subject to disclosure ob-
ligations under sections 615(a) and 615(b).

2. Examples

The term “person” includes universities,

creditors, collection agencies, insurance
companies, private investigators, and em-
ployers.

Section 6038(c) defines the term consumer to
mean “an individual.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

The term “consumer” denotes an individual
entitled to the Act’s protections. Consumer
reports, as defined in section 603(d), are re-
ports about consumers. A “consumer” is enti-
tled to obtain disclosures under section 609
from consumer reporting agencies and to
take certain steps that require such agencies
to follow procedures in section 611, con-
cerning disputes about the completeness or
accuracy of items of information in the con-
sumer’s file. Disclosures required under sec-
tion 606 by one procuring an investigative re-
port must be made to the “consumer” on
whom the report is sought. Notifications re-
quired by section 615 must be provided to
“consumers.” A “consumer” is the party enti-
tled to sue for willful noncompliance (sec-
tion 616) or negligent noncompliance (section
617) with the Act’s requirements.

2. General

The definition includes only a natural per-
son. It does not include artificial entities
(e.g., partnerships, corporations, trusts, es-
tates, cooperatives, associations) or entities
created by statute (e.g., governments, gov-
ernmental subdivisions or agencies).

Section 603(d) defines consumer report to
mean “any written, oral, or other commu-
nication of any information by a consumer
reporting agency bearing on a consumer’s
credit worthiness, credit standing, credit ca-
pacity, character, general reputation, per-
sonal characteristics, or mode of living
which is used or expected to be used or col-
lected in whole or in part for the purpose of
serving as a factor in establishing the con-
sumer’s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance
to be used primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) employment pur-
poses, or (8) other purposes authorized under
Section 604” (with three specific exclusions).

1. Relation to “Consumer Reporting Agency”

To be a “consumer report,” the information
must be furnished by a “consumer reporting
agency” as that term is defined in section
6038(f). Conversely, the term “consumer re-
porting agency” is restricted to persons that
regularly engage in assembling or evaluating
consumer credit information or other infor-
mation on consumers for the purpose of fur-
nishing “consumer reports” to third parties.

547
Pt. 600, App.

In other words, the terms “consumer report-
ing agency” in section 603(f) and “consumer
report” in section 603 (d)) are mutually de-
pendent and must therefore be construed to-
gether. For example, information is not a
“consumer report” if the person furnishing
the information is clearly not a “consumer
reporting agency” (e.g., if the person fur-
nishing the information does not regularly
furnish such information for monetary fees
or on a cooperative nonprofit basis).

2. Relation to the Applicability of the Act

If a report is not a “consumer report,” then
the Act does not usually apply to it.1 For ex-
ample, because a commercial credit report is
not a report on a consumer, it is not a “con-
sumer report”. Therefore, the user need not
notify the subject of the name and address of
the credit bureau when taking adverse ac-
tion, and the provider need not omit “obso-
lete” information, as would be required if the
FCRA applied.

3. Report Concerning a “Consumer’s
Attributes and History

A. General. A “consumer report” is a report
on a “consumer” to be used for certain pur-
poses involving that “consumer.”

B. Artificial entities. Reports about corpora-
tions, associations, and other collective enti-
ties are not consumer reports, and the Act
does not apply to them.

C. Reports on businesses for business pur-
poses. Reports used to determine the eligi-
bility of a business, rather than a consumer,
for certain purposes, are not consumer re-
ports and the FCRA does not apply to them,
even if they contain information on individ-
uals, because Congress did not intend for the
FCRA to apply to reports used for commer-
cial purposes (see 116 Cong. Rec. 36572 (1970)
(Conf. Report on H.R. 15078)).

4. “(C)redit Worthiness, Credit Standing,
Credit Capacity, Character, General Rep-
utation, Personal Characteristics, or Mode
of Living * * *”

A. General. To be a “consumer report,” the
information must bear on at least one of the
seven characteristics listed in this defini-
tion.

B. Credit guides. Credit guides are listings,
furnished by credit bureaus to credit
grantors, that rate how well consumers pay
their bills. Such guides are a series of “con-
sumer reports,” because they contain infor-
mation which is used for the purpose of serv-
ing as a factor in establishing the con-

1However, a creditor denying a consumer’s
application based on a report from a “third
party” must give the disclosure required by
section 615(b).

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

sumers’ eligibility for credit. However, if
they are coded (by identification such as so-
cial security number, driver’s license num-
ber, or bank account number) so that the
consumer’s identity is not disclosed, they
are not “consumer reports” until decoded.
(See discussion of uncoded credit guides
under section 604(3)(A), item 8 infra.)

C. Motor vehicle reports. Motor vehicle re-
ports are distributed by state motor vehicle
departments, generally to insurance compa-
nies upon request, and usually reveal a con-
sumer’s entire driving record, including ar-
rests for driving offenses. Such reports are
consumer reports when they are sold by a
Department of Motor Vehicles for insurance
underwriting purposes and contain informa-
tion bearing on the consumer’s “personal
characteristics,” such as arrest information.
The Act’s legislative history indicates Con-
gress intended the Act to cover mutually
beneficial exchanges of information between
commercial enterprises rather than between
governmental entities. Accordingly, these
reports are not consumer reports when pro-
vided to other governmental authorities in-
volved in licensing or law enforcement ac-
tivities. (See discussion titled “State Depart-
ments of Motor Vehicles,” under section
6038(f), item 10 infra.)

D. Consumer lists. A list of the names of
creditworthy individuals, or of individuals
on whom credit bureaus have derogatory in-
formation, is a series of “consumer reports”
because the information bears on credit wor-
thiness.

E. Public record information. A report solely
of public record information is not a “con-
sumer report” unless that information is pro-
vided by a consumer reporting agency, is col-
lected or used for the purposes identified in
section 603(d), and bears on at least one of
the seven characteristics listed in the defini-
tion. Public record information relating to
records of arrest, or the institution or dis-
position of civil or criminal proceedings,
bears on one or more of these characteris-
tics.

F. Name and address. A report limited sole-
ly to the consumer’s name and address alone,
with no connotations as to credit worthiness
or other characteristics, does not constitute
a “consumer report,” if it does not bear on
any of the seven factors.

G. Rental characteristics. Reports about
rental characteristics (e.g., consumers’ evic-
tions, rental payment histories, treatment of
premises) are consumer reports, because
they relate to character, general reputation,
personal characteristics, or mode of living.

5. “(U)sed or Expected To Be Used or Col-
lected in Whole or in Part for the Purpose
of Serving as a Factor in Establishing the
Consumer’s Eligibility * * *”

A. Law enforcement bulletins. Bulletins that
are limited to a series of descriptions, some-
times accompanied by photographs, of indi-
viduals who are being sought by law enforce-
ment authorities for alleged crimes are not a
series of “consumer reports” because they
have not been collected for use in evaluating
consumers for credit, insurance, employment
or other consumer purposes, and it cannot
reasonably be anticipated they will be used
for such purposes.

B. Directories. Telephone directories and
city directories, to the extent they only pro-
vide information regarding name, address
and phone number, marital status, home
ownership, and number of children, are not
“consumer reports,” because the information
is not used or expected to be used in evalu-
ating consumers for credit, insurance, em-
ployment or other purposes and does not re-
flect on credit standing, credit worthiness,
or any of the other factors. A list of names
of individuals with checking accounts is not
a series of consumer reports because the in-
formation does not bear on credit worthiness
or any of the other factors. A trade direc-
tory, such as a list of all insurance agents li-
censed to do business in a state, is not a se-
ries of consumer reports because it is com-
mercial information that would be used for
commercial purposes.

C. Use of prior consumer report in prepara-
tion. A report that would not otherwise be a
consumer report may be a consumer report,
notwithstanding the purpose for which it is
furnished, if it includes a prior consumer re-
port or information from consumer report
files, because it would contain some informa-
tion “collected in whole or in part” for con-
sumer reporting purposes. For example, an
insurance claims report would be a consumer
report if a consumer report (or information
from a consumer report) were used to pre-
pare it. (See discussion, infra, in item 6-C
under this subsection.)

D. Use of reports for purposes not anticipated
by the reporting party. The question arises
whether a report that is not otherwise a con-
sumer report is subject to the FCRA because
the recipient subsequently uses the report
for a permissible purpose. If the reporting
party’s procedures are such that it neither
knows of nor should reasonably anticipate
such use, the report is not a consumer re-
port. If a reporting party has taken reason-
able steps to insure that the report is not
used for such a purpose, and if it neither
knows of, nor can reasonably anticipate such
use, the report should not be deemed a con-
sumer report by virtue of uses beyond the re-
porting party’s control. A reporting party
might establish that it does not reasonably

Pt. 600, App.

anticipate such use of the report by requir-
ing the recipient to certify that the report
will not be used for one of the purposes listed
in section 604. (Such procedure may be com-
pared to the requirement in section 607(a),
discussed infra, that consumer reporting
agencies furnishing consumer reports require
that prospective users certify the purposes
for which the information is sought and cer-
tify that the information will be used for no
other purpose.) For example, a claims report-
ing service could use such a certification to
avoid having its insurance claims reports
deemed “consumer reports” if the report re-
cipient/insurer were to use the report later
for “underwriting purposes” under section
604(8)(C), such as terminating insurance cov-
erage or raising the premium.

6. “(E)stablishing the Consumer’s Eligibility
for (1) Credit or Insurance To Be Used Pri-
marily for Personal, Family or Household
Purposes, or (2) Employment Purposes, or
(3) Other Purposes Authorized Under Sec-
tion 604”

A. Relation to section 604. Because section
603(d)(8) refers to “purposes authorized under
section 604” (often described as “permissible
purposes” of consumer reports), some of
which overlap purposes enumerated in sec-
tion 608 (e.g., 603(d)(1) and 608(d)(2)), sections
603 and 604 must be construed together, to
determine what are “consumer reports” and
“permissible purposes” under the two sec-
tions. See discussion infra, under section 604.

B. Commercial credit or insurance. A report
on a consumer for credit or insurance in con-
nection with a business operated by the con-
sumer is not a “consumer report,” and the
Act does not apply to it.

C. Insurance claims reports. (It is assumed
that information in prior consumer reports
is not used in claims reports. See discussion,
supra, in item 5-C under this subsection.) Re-
ports provided to insurers by claims inves-
tigation services solely to determine the va-
lidity of insurance claims are not consumer
reports, because section 604(8)(C) specifically
sets forth only underwriting (not claims) as
an insurance-related purpose, and section
6038(d)(1) deals specifically with eligibility for
insurance and no other insurance-related
purposes. To construe section 604(8)(E) as in-
cluding reports furnished in connection with
insurance claims would be to disregard the
specific language of sections 604(3)(C) and
603(d)(1).

D. Scope of employment purpose. A report
that is used or is expected to be used or col-
lected in whole or in part in connection with
establishing an employee’s eligibility for
“promotion, reassignment or retention,” as
well as to evaluate a job applicant, is a con-
sumer report because sections 6038(d)(2) and
604(3)(B) use the term “employment pur-
poses,” which section 603(h) defines to in-
clude these situations.

549
Pt. 600, App.

E. Bad check lists. A report indicating that
an individual has issued bad checks, provided
by printed list or otherwise, to a business for
use in determining whether to accept con-
sumers’ checks tendered in transactions pri-
marily for personal, family or household pur-
poses, is a consumer report. The information
furnished bears on consumers’ character,
general reputation and personal characteris-
tics, and it is used or expected to be used in
connection with business transactions in-
volving consumers.

F. Tenant screening reports. A report used to
determine whether to rent a residence to a
consumer is a consumer report, because it is
used for a business transaction that the con-
sumer wishes to enter into for personal, fam-
ily or household purposes.

7. Exclusions From the Definition of
“Consumer Report”

A. “(Any) reports containing information sole-
ly as to transactions or experiences between the
consumer and the person making the report;”’—
(1) Examples of Sources. The exemption ap-
plies to reports limited to transactions or ex-
periences between the consumer and the en-
tity making the report (e.g., retail stores,
hospitals, present or former employers,
banks, mortgage servicing companies, credit
unions, or universities).

(2) Information beyond the reporting entity’s
own transactions or experiences with the con-
sumer. The exemption does not apply to re-
ports by these entities of information beyond
their own transactions or experiences with
the consumer. An example is a creditor’s or
an insurance company’s report of the reasons
it cancelled credit or insurance, based on in-
formation from an outside source.

(8) Opinions Concerning Transactions or
Experiences

The exemption applies to reports that are
not limited to the facts, but also include
opinions (e.g., use of the term “slow pay” to
describe a consumer’s transactions with a
creditor), as long as the facts underlying the
opinions involve only transactions or experi-
ences between the consumer and the report-
ing entity.

B. “(A)ny authorization or approval of a spe-
cific extension of credit directly or indirectly by
the issuer of a credit card or similar device;’—
(1) General. The exemption applies to a credit
or debit card issuer’s written, oral, or elec-
tronic communication of its decision wheth-
er or not to authorize a charge, in response
to a request from a merchant or other party
that the consumer has asked to honor the
card.

C. “(A)ny report in which a person who has
been requested by a third party to make a spe-
cific extension of credit directly or indirectly to
the consumer conveys his decision with respect
to such request, if the third party advises the

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

consumer of the name and address of the person
to whom the request was made and such person
makes the disclosures to the consumer required
under section 615.”—(1) General. The exemp-
tion covers retailers’ attempts to obtain
credit for their individual customers from an
outside source (such as a bank or a finance
company). The communication by the finan-
cial institution of its decision whether to ex-
tend credit is not a “consumer report” if the
retailer informs the customer of the name
and address of the financial institution to
which the application or contract is offered
and the financial institution makes the dis-
closures required by section 615 of the Act.
Such disclosures must be made only when
there is a denial of, or increase in the charge
for, credit or insurance. (See discussion of
section 615, item 10, infra.)

(2) Information included in the exemption.
The exemption is not limited to a simple
“ves” or “no” response, but includes the infor-
mation constituting the basis for the credit
denial, because it applies to “any report.”

(3) How third party creditors can insure that
the exemption applies. Creditors, who are re-
quested by dealers or merchants to make
such specific extensions of credit, can assure
that communication of their decision to the
dealer or merchant will be exempt under this
section from the term “consumer report,” by
having written agreements that require such
parties to inform the consumer of the credi-
tor’s name and address and by complying
with any applicable provisions of section 615.

Section 608(e) defines “investigative con-
sumer report” as “a consumer report or por-
tion thereof in which information on a con-
sumer’s character, general reputation, per-
sonal characteristics, or mode of living is ob-
tained through personal interviews with
neighbors, friends, or associates of the con-
sumer reported on or with others with whom
he is acquainted or who may have knowledge
concerning any such items of information.
However, such information shall not include
specific factual information on a consumer’s
credit record obtained directly from a cred-
itor of the consumer or from a consumer re-
porting agency when such information was
obtained directly from a creditor of the con-
sumer or from the consumer.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

The term investigative consumer report de-
notes a subset of “consumer report” for which
the Act imposes additional requirements on
recipients and consumer reporting agencies.
Persons procuring “investigative consumer
reports” must make certain disclosures to
the consumers who are the subjects of the re-
ports, aS required by section 606. Consumer
reporting agencies must comply with section
614, when furnishing “investigative consumer
reports” containing adverse information that
is not a matter of public record. Consumer

590
Federal Trade Commission

reporting agencies making disclosure to con-
sumers pursuant to section 609 are not re-
quired to disclose “sources of information ac-
quired solely for use in preparing an inves-
tigative consumer report and actually used
for no other purpose.”

2. General

An “investigative consumer report” is a
type of “consumer report” that contains in-
formation that is both related to a con-
sumer’s character, general reputation, per-
sonal characteristics or mode of living and
obtained by personal interviews with the
consumer’s neighbors, friends, associates or
others.

3. Types of Sources Interviewed

A report consisting of information from
any third party concerning the subject’s
character (reputation, etc.) may be an inves-
tigative consumer report because the phrase
“obtained through personal inter-
views * * * with others” includes any source
that is a third party interviewee. A report
containing interview information obtained
solely from the subject is not an “investiga-
tive consumer report.”

4. Telephone Interviews

A consumer report that contains informa-
tion on a consumer’s “character, general rep-
utation, personal characteristics or mode of
living” obtained through telephone inter-
views with third parties is an “investigative
consumer report,” because “personal inter-
views” includes interviews conducted by tele-
phone as well as in person.

5. Identity of Interviewer

A consumer report is an “investigative con-
sumer report” if personal interviews are used
to obtain information reported on a con-
sumer’s “character, general reputation, per-
sonal characteristics or mode of living,” re-
gardless of who conducted the interview.

6. Noninvestigative Information in
“Investigative Consumer Reports”

An “investigative consumer report” may
also contain noninvestigative information,
because the definition includes reports, a
“portion” of which are investigative reports.

7. Exclusions From “Investigative Consumer
Reports”

A report that consists solely of informa-
tion gathered from observation by one who
drives by the consumer’s residence is not an
“investigative consumer report,” because it
contains no information from “personal
interviews.”

Section 6038(f) defines “consumer reporting
agency” as “any person which, for monetary
fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit

Pt. 600, App.

basis, regularly engages in whole or in part
in the practice of assembling or evaluating
consumer credit information or other infor-
mation on consumers for the purpose of fur-
nishing consumer reports to third parties,
and which uses any means or facility of
interstate commerce for the purpose of pre-
paring or furnishing consumer reports.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

A. Duties imposed on “consumer reporting
agencies.” The Act imposes a number of du-
ties on “consumer reporting agencies.” They
must have permissible purposes to furnish
consumer reports (section 604), avoid fur-
nishing obsolete adverse information in cer-
tain consumer reports (sections 605, 607(a)),
adopt reasonable procedures to assure pri-
vacy (section 604, 607(a)), and accuracy (sec-
tion 607(b)) of consumer reports, provide only
limited disclosures to governmental agencies
(section 608), provide consumers certain dis-
closures upon request (sections 609 and 610)
at no cost or for a reasonable charge (section
612), follow certain procedures if a consumer
disputes the completeness or accuracy of any
item of information contained in his file
(section 611), and follow certain procedures
in reporting public record information for
employment purposes or when reporting ad-
verse information other than public record
information in investigative consumer re-
ports (sections 618, 614).

B. Relation to “consumer reports.” The term
consumer reporting agency, as defined in sec-
tion 603(f), includes certain persons who as-
semble or evaluate information on individ-
uals for the purpose of furnishing “consumer
reports” to third parties. Conversely, section
6038(d) defines the term consumer report to
mean the communication of certain informa-
tion by a “consumer reporting agency.” In
other words, the terms “consumer report” in
section 603(d) and “consumer reporting agen-
cy” as defined in section 603(f) are defined in
a mutually dependent manner and must
therefore be construed together. For exam-
ple, a party is not a “consumer reporting
agency” if it provides only information that
is excepted from the definition of “consumer
report” under section 603(d), such as reports
limited to the party’s own transactions or
experiences with a consumer, or credit infor-
mation on organizations.

2. Isolated Reports

Parties that do not “regularly” engage in
assembling or evaluating information for the
purpose of furnishing consumer reports to
third parties are not consumer reporting
agencies. For example, a creditor that fur-
nished information on a consumer to a gov-
ernmental entity in connection with one of
its investigations, would not “regularly” be
making such disclosure for a fee or on a co-
operative nonprofit basis, and therefore

5ol
Pt. 600, App.

would not become a consumer reporting
agency, even if the information exceeded the
creditor’s transactions or experiences with
the consumer.

3. Provision of Credit Report to Report
Subject

A consumer report user does not become a
consumer reporting agency by regularly giv-
ing a copy of the report, or otherwise dis-
closing it, to the consumer who is the sub-
ject of the report, because it is not disclosing
the information to a “third party.”

4. Employment Agency

An employment agency that routinely ob-
tains information on job applicants from
their former employers and furnishes the in-
formation to prospective employers is a con-
sumer reporting agency.

5. Information Compiled for Insurance
Underwriting

A business that compiles claim payment
histories on individuals from insurers and
furnishes them to insurance companies for
use in underwriting decisions concerning
those individuals is a consumer reporting
agency.

6. Private Investigators and Detective
Agencies

Private investigators and detective agen-
cies that regularly obtain consumer reports
and furnish them to clients may thereby be-
come consumer reporting agencies.

7. Collection Agencies and Creditors

Collection agencies and creditors become
consumer reporting agencies if they regu-
larly furnish information beyond their trans-
actions or experiences with consumers to
third parties for use in connection with con-
sumers’ transactions.

8. Joint Users of Consumer Reports

Entities that share consumer reports with
others that are jointly involved in decisions
for which there are permissible purposes to
obtain the reports may be “joint users” rath-
er than consumer reporting agencies. For ex-
ample, if a lender forwards consumer reports
to governmental agencies administering loan
guarantee programs (or to other prospective
loan insurers or guarantors), or to other par-
ties whose approval is needed before it
grants credit, or to another creditor for use
in considering a consumer’s loan application
at the consumer’s request, the lender does
not become a consumer reporting agency by
virtue of such action. An agent or employee
that obtains consumer reports does not be-
come a consumer reporting agency by shar-
ing such reports with its principal or em-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

ployer in connection with the purposes for
which the reports were initially obtained.

9. Loan Exchanges

Loan exchanges, which are generally
owned and operated on a cooperative basis
by consumer finance companies, constitute a
mechanism whereby each member furnishes
the exchange information concerning the
full identity and loan amount of each of its
borrowers, and receives information from the
exchange concerning the number and types
of outstanding loans for each of its appli-
cants. A loan exchange or any other ex-
change that regularly collects information
bearing on decisions to grant consumers
credit or insurance for personal, family or
household purposes, or employment, is a
“consumer reporting agency.”

10. State Departments of Motor Vehicles

State motor vehicle departments are “con-
sumer reporting agencies” if they regularly
furnish motor vehicle reports containing in-
formation bearing on the consumer’s “per-
sonal characteristics,” such as arrest infor-
mation, to insurance companies for insur-
ance underwriting purposes. (See discussion
of motor vehicle reports under section 603(d),
item 4c supra.)

11. Federal Agencies

The Office of Personnel Management col-
lects and files data concerning current and
potential employees of the Federal Govern-
ment and transmits that information to
other government agencies for employment
purposes. Because Congress did not intend
that the FCRA apply to the Office of Per-
sonnel Management and similar federal
agencies (see 116 Cong. Rec. 36576 (1970) (re-
marks of Rep. Brown)), no such agency is a
“consumer reporting agency.”

12. Credit Application Information

A creditor that provides information from
a consumer’s application to a credit bureau,
for verification as part of the creditor’s eval-
uation process that includes obtaining a re-
port on the consumer from that credit bu-
reau, does not thereby become a “consumer
reporting agency,” because the creditor does
not provide the information for “fees, dues,
or on a cooperative nonprofit basis,” but
rather pays the bureau to verify the informa-
tion when it provides a consumer report on
the applicant.

Section 603(g¢) defines file, when used in
connection with information on any con-
sumer, to mean “all of the information on
that consumer recorded and retained by a
consumer reporting agency regardless of how
the information is stored.”

502
Federal Trade Commission

1. Relation to Other Sections

Consumer reporting agencies are required
to make disclosures of all information in
their “files” to consumers upon request (sec-
tion 609) and to follow reinvestigation proce-
dures if the consumer disputes the complete-
ness or accuracy of any item of information
contained in his “file” (section 611).

2. General

The term file denotes all information on
the consumer that is recorded and retained
by a consumer reporting agency that might
be furnished, or has been furnished, in a con-
sumer report on that consumer.

38. Audit Trail

The term “file” does not include an “audit
trail” (a list of changes made by a consumer
reporting agency to a consumer’s credit his-
tory record, maintained to detect fraudulent
changes to that record), because such infor-
mation is not furnished in consumer reports
or used as a basis for preparing them.

4. Other Information

The term “file” does not include informa-
tion in billing records or in the consumer re-
lations folder that a consumer reporting
agency opens on a consumer who obtains dis-
closures or files a dispute, if the information
has not been used in a consumer report and
would not be used in preparing one.

Section 608(h) defines employment purposes
to mean “a report used for the purpose of
evaluating a consumer for employment, pro-
motion, reassignment or retention as an em-
ployee.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

The term employment purposes is used as
part of the definition of “consumer reports”
(section 608(d)(2)) and as a permissible pur-
pose for the furnishing of consumer reports
(section 604(8)(B)). Where an investigative
consumer report is to be used for “employ-
ment purposes” for which a consumer has not
specifically applied, section 606(a)(2) provides
that the notice otherwise required by section
606(a)(1) need not be sent. When a consumer
reporting agency furnishes public record in-
formation in reports “for employment pur-
poses,” it must follow the procedure set out
in section 618.

2. Security Clearances

A report in connection with security clear-
ances of a government contractor’s employ-
ees would be for “employment purposes”
under this section.

Section 603(i) defines medical information to
mean “information or records obtained, with
the consent of the individual to whom it re-
lates, from licensed physicians or medical

Pt. 600, App.

practitioners, hospitals, clinics, or other
medical or medically related facilities.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

Under section 609(a)(1), a consumer report-
ing agency must, upon the consumer’s re-
quest and proper identification, disclose the
nature and substance of all information in
its files on the consumer, except “medical in-
formation.”

2. Information From Non-medical Sources

Information from non-medical sources
such as employers, is not “medical informa-
tion.”

Section 604—Permissible Purposes of Reports

“A consumer reporting agency may furnish a
consumer report under the following cir-
cumstances and no other: * * *”

1. Relation to Section 603

Sections 603(d)(3) and 604 must be con-
strued together to determine what are “per-
missible purposes,” because section 6038(d)(8)
refers to “purposes authorized under section
604” (often described as “permissible pur-
poses” of consumer reports), and some pur-
poses are enumerated in section 608 (e.g., sec-
tions 6038(d)(1) and 603(d)(2)). Subsections of
sections 603 and 604 that specifically set
forth “permissible purposes” relating to cred-
it, insurance and employment, are the only
subsections that cover “permissible purposes”
relating to those three areas. Section
604(3)(E), a general subsection, is limited to
purposes not otherwise addressed in section
604(3) (A)-(D).

A. Credit. Sections 603(d)(1)—which defines
“consumer report” to include certain reports
for the purpose of serving as a factor in es-
tablishing the consumer’s eligibility for
credit or insurance primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes—and 604(8)(A)
must be read together as fully describing
permissible purposes involving credit for ob-
taining consumer reports. Accordingly, sec-
tion 604(3)(A) permits the furnishing of a
consumer report for use in connection with a
credit transaction involving the consumer,
primarily for personal, family or household
purposes, and involving the extension of
credit to, or review or collection of an ac-
count of, the consumer.

B. Insurance. Sections 603(d)(1) and 604(38)(C)
must be read together as describing the only
permissible insurance purposes for obtaining
consumer reports. Accordingly, section
604(8)(C) permits the furnishing of a con-
sumer report, provided it is for use in con-
nection with the underwriting of insurance
involving the consumer, primarily for per-
sonal, family, or household purposes.

C. Employment. Employment is covered ex-
clusively by sections 608(d)(2) and 604(8)(B),

593
Pt. 600, App.

and by section 608(h) (which defines “em-
ployment purposes”). Therefore, “permissible
purposes” relating to employment include re-
ports used for evaluating a consumer “for
employment, promotion, reassignment or re-
tention as an employee.”

D. Other purposes. “Other purposes” are re-
ferred to in section 603(d)(3) and covered by
section 604(3)(E), as well as sections 604(1),
604(2) and 604(3)(D) (which contain specific
purposes not involving credit, insurance, em-
ployment). Permissible purposes relating to
section 604(8)(E) are limited to transactions
that consumers enter into primarily for per-
sonal, family or household purposes (exclud-
ing credit, insurance or employment, which
are specifically covered by other subsections
discussed above). The FCRA does not cover
reports furnished for transactions that con-
sumers enter into primarily in connection
with businesses they operate (e.g., a con-
sumer’s rental of equipment for use in his re-
tail store).

2. Relation to Other Sections

A. Section 607(a). Section 607(a) requires
consumer reporting agencies to Keep infor-
mation confidential by furnishing consumer
reports only for purposes listed under section
604, and to follow specified, reasonable proce-
dures to achieve this end. Section 619 pro-
vides criminal sanctions against any person
who knowingly and willfully obtains infor-
mation on a consumer from a consumer re-
porting agency under false pretenses.

B. Section 608. Section 608 allows “consumer
reporting agencies” to furnish governmental
agencies specified identifying information
concerning consumers, notwithstanding the
limitations of section 604.

Section 604(1)—A consumer reporting agen-
cy may furnish a consumer report “in re-
sponse to the order of a court having juris-
diction to issue such an order.”

1. Subpoena

A subpoena, including a grand jury sub-
poena, is not an “order of a court” unless
signed by a judge.

2. Internal Revenue Service Summons

An I.R.S. summons is an exception to the
requirement that an order be signed by a
judge before it constitutes an “order of a
court” under this section, because a 1976 revi-
sion to Federal statutes (26 U.S.C. 7609) spe-
cifically requires a consumer reporting agen-
cy to furnish a consumer report in response
to an LR.S. summons upon receipt of the
designated I.R.S. certificate that the con-
sumer has not filed a timely motion to quash
the summons.

Section 604(2)—A consumer reporting agen-
cy may furnish a consumer report “in accord-
ance with the written instructions of the
consumer to whom it relates.”

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

1. No Other Permissible Purpose Needed

If the report subject furnishes written au-
thorization for a report, that creates a per-
missible purpose for furnishing the report.

2. Refusal to Furnish Report

The consumer reporting agency may refuse
to furnish the report because the statute is
permissive, not mandatory. (Requirements
that consumer reporting agencies make dis-
closure to consumers (as contrasted with fur-
nishing reports to users) are discussed under
sections 609 and 610, infra.)

Section 604(8)(A)—A consumer reporting
agency may issue a consumer report to “a
person which it has reason to believe * * *
intends to use the information in connection
with a credit transaction involving the con-
sumer on whom the information is to be fur-
nished and involving the extension of credit
to, or review or collection of an account of,
the consumer;”

1. Reports Sought in Connection with the
“Review or Collection of an Account”

A. Reports for collection. A collection agen-
cy has a permissible purpose under this sec-
tion to receive a consumer report on a con-
sumer for use in attempting to collect that
consumer’s debt, regardless of whether that
debt is assigned or referred for collection.
Similarly, a detective agency or private in-
vestigator, attempting to collect a debt owed
by a consumer, would have a permissible
purpose to obtain a consumer report on that
individual for use in collecting that debt. An
attorney may obtain a consumer report
under this section on a consumer for use in
connection with a decision whether to sue
that individual to collect a credit account.

B. Unsolicited reports. A consumer reporting
agency may not send an unsolicited con-
sumer report to the recipient of a previous
report on the same consumer, because the re-
cipient will not necessarily have a permis-
sible purpose to receive the unsolicited re-
port.2 For example, the recipient may have
rejected the consumer’s application or
ceased to do business with the consumer.
(See also discussion in section 607, item 2G,
infra.)

2. Judgment Creditors

A judgment creditor has a permissible pur-
pose to receive a consumer report on the
judgment debtor for use in connection with
collection of the judgment debt, because it is

2Of course a consumer reporting agency
must furnish notifications required by sec-
tion 611(d), upon the consumer’s requests, to
prior recipients of reports containing dis-
puted information that is deleted or that is
the subject of a dispute statement under sec-
tion 611(b).

504
Federal Trade Commission

in the same position as any creditor at-
tempting to collect a debt from a consumer
who is the subject of a consumer report.

3. Child Support Debts

A district attorney’s office or other child
support agency may obtain a consumer re-
port in connection with enforcement of the
report subject’s child support obligation, es-
tablished by court (or quasi-judicial adminis-
trative) orders, since the agency is acting as
or on behalf of the judgment creditor, and is,
in effect, collecting a debt. However, a con-
sumer reporting agency may not furnish con-
sumer reports to child support agencies seek-
ing to establish paternity or the duty to pay
child support.

4, Tax Obligations

A tax collection agency has no general per-
missible purpose to obtain a consumer report
to collect delinquent tax accounts, because
this subsection applies only to collection of
“credit” accounts. However, if a tax collec-
tion agency acquired a tax lien having the
same effect as a judgment or obtained a
judgment, it would be a judgment creditor
and would have a permissible purpose for ob-
taining a consumer report on the consumer
who owed the tax. Similarly, if a consumer
taxpayer entered an agreement with a tax
collection agency to pay taxes according to
some timetable, that agreement would cre-
ate a debtor-creditor relationship, thereby
giving the agency a permissible purpose to
obtain a consumer report on that consumer.

5. Information on an Applicant’s Spouse

A. Permissible purpose. A creditor may re-
quest any information concerning an appli-
cant’s spouse if that spouse will be permitted
to use the account or will be contractually
liable upon the account, or the applicant is
relying on the spouse’s income as a basis for
repayment of the credit requested. A cred-
itor may request any information concerning
an applicant’s spouse if (1) the state law doc-
trine of necessaries applies to the trans-
action, or (2) the applicant resides in a com-
munity property state, or (3) the property
upon which the applicant is relying as a
basis for repayment of the credit requested is
located in such a state, or (4) the applicant
is acting as the agent of the nonapplicant
spouse.

B. Lack of permissible purpose. If the cred-
itor receives information clearly indicating
that the applicant is not acting as the agent
of the nonapplicant spouse, and that the ap-
plicant is relying only on separate property
to repay the credit extended, and that the
state law doctrine of necessaries does not
apply to the transaction and that the appli-
cant does not reside in a community prop-
erty state, the creditor does not have a per-
missible purpose for obtaining a report on a

Pt. 600, App.

nonapplicant spouse. A permissible purpose
for making a consumer report on a non-
applicant spouse can never exist under the
FCRA, where Regulation B, issued under the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (12 CFR 202),
prohibits the creditor from requesting infor-
mation on such spouse. There is no permis-
sible purpose to obtain a consumer report on
a nonapplicant former spouse or on a non-
applicant spouse who has legally separated
or otherwise indicated an intent to legally
disassociate with the marriage. (This does
not preclude reporting a prior joint credit
account of former spouses for which the
spouse that is the subject of the report is
still contractually liable. See discussion in
section 607, item 3—-D infra.)

6. Prescreening

Prescreening means the process whereby a
consumer reporting agency compiles or edits
a list of consumers who meet specific cri-
teria and provides this list to the client ora
third party (such as a mailing service) on be-
half of the client for use in soliciting these
consumers for the client’s products or serv-
ices. The process may also include demo-
graphic or other analysis of the consumers
on the list (e.g., use of census tract data re-
flecting real estate values) by the consumer
reporting agency or by a third party em-
ployed for that purpose (by either the agency
or its client) before the list is provided to the
consumer reporting agency’s client. In such
situations, the client’s creditworthiness cri-
teria may be provided only to the consumer
reporting agency and not to the third party
performing the demographic analysis. The
consumer reporting agency that performs a
“prescreening” service may furnish a client
with several different lists of consumers who
meet different sets of creditworthiness cri-
teria supplied by the client, who intends to
make different credit offers (e.g., various
credit limits) to consumers who meet the dif-
ferent criteria.

A prescreened list constitutes a series of
consumer reports, because the list conveys
the information that each consumer named
meets certain criteria for creditworthiness.
Prescreening is permissible under the FCRA
if the client agrees in advance that each con-
sumer whose name is on the list after
prescreening will receive an offer of credit.
In these circumstances, a permissible pur-
pose for the prescreening service exists under
this section, because of the client’s present
intent to grant credit to all consumers on
the final list, with the result that the infor-
mation is used “in connection with a credit
transaction involving the consumer on whom
the information is to be furnished and in-
volving the extension of credit to * * * the
consumer.”

595
Pt. 600, App.

7. Seller of Property Extending Credit

A seller of property has a permissible pur-
pose under this subsection to obtain a con-
sumer report on a prospective purchaser to
whom he is planning to extend credit.

8. Uncoded Credit Guides

A consumer reporting agency may not fur-
nish an uncoded credit guide, because the re-
cipient does not have a permissible purpose
to obtain a consumer report on each con-
sumer listed. (As discussed under section
603(d), item 4 supra, credit guides are listings
that credit bureaus furnish to. credit
grantors, rating how consumers pay their
bills. Such guides are a series of “consumer
reports” on the “consumers” listed therein,
unless coded so that the consumer’s identity
is not disclosed.)

9, Liability for Bad Checks

A party attempting to recover the amount
due on a bad check is attempting to collect
a debt and, therefore, has a permissible pur-
pose to obtain a consumer report on the con-
sumer who wrote it, and on any other con-
sumer who is liable for the amount of that
check under applicable state law.

Section 604(3)(B)—A consumer reporting
agency may issue a consumer report to “a
person which it has reason to believe * * *
intends to use the information for employ-
ment purposes;”

1. Current Employees

An employer may obtain a consumer re-
port on a current employee in connection
with an investigation of the disappearance of
money from employment premises, because
“retention as an employee” is included in the
definition of “employment purposes” (section
603(h)).

2. Consumer Reports on Applicants and Non-
applicants

An employer may obtain a consumer re-
port for use in evaluating the subject’s appli-
cation for employment but may not obtain a
consumer report to evaluate the application
of a consumer who is not the subject of the
report.

3. Grand Jurors

The fact that grand jurors are usually paid
a stipend for their service does not provide a
district attorney’s office a permissible pur-
pose for obtaining consumer reports on
them, because such service is a duty, not
“employment.”

Section 604(3)(C)—A consumer reporting
agency may issue a consumer report to “a
person which it has reason to believe * * *
intends to use the information in connection
with the underwriting of insurance involving
the consumer;”

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

1. Underwriting

An insurer may obtain a consumer report
to decide whether or not to issue a policy to
the consumer, the amount and terms of cov-
erage, the duration of the policy, the rates or
fees charged, or whether or not to renew or
cancel a policy, because these are all “under-
writing” decisions.

2. Claims

An insurer may not obtain a consumer re-
port for the purpose of evaluating a claim (to
ascertain its validity or otherwise determine
what action should be taken), because per-
missible purposes relating to insurance are
limited by this section to “underwriting”
purposes.

Section 604(8)(D)—A consumer reporting
agency may issue a consumer report to “a
person which it has reason to believe * * *
intends to use the information in connection
with a determination of the consumer’s eligi-
bility for a license or other benefit granted
by a governmental instrumentality required
by law to consider an applicant’s financial
responsibility or status * * *”

1. Appropriate recipient

Any party charged by law (including a rule
or regulation having the force of law) with
responsibility for assessing the consumer’s
eligibility for the benefit (not only the agen-
cy directly responsible for administering the
benefit) has a permissible purpose to receive
a consumer report. For example, a district
attorney’s office or social services bureau,
required by law to consider a consumer’s fi-
nancial status in determining whether that
consumer qualifies for welfare benefits, has a
permissible purpose to obtain a report on the
consumer for that purpose. Similarly, con-
sumer reporting agencies may furnish con-
sumer reports to townships on consumers
whose financial status the townships are re-
quired by law to consider in determining the
consumers’ eligibility for assistance, or to
professional boards (e.g., bar examiners) re-
quired by law to consider such information
on applicants for admission to practice.

2. Inappropriate Recipient

Parties not charged with the responsibility
of determining a consumer’s eligibility for a
license or other benefit, for example, a party
competing for an FCC radio station con-
struction permit, would not have a permis-
sible purpose to obtain a consumer report on
that consumer.

3. Initial or Continuing Benefit

The permissible purpose includes the de-
termination of a consumer’s continuing eli-
gibility for a benefit, as well as the evalua-
tion of a consumer’s initial application for a
benefit. If the governmental body has reason

506
Federal Trade Commission

to believe a particular consumer’s eligibility
is in doubt, or wishes to conduct random
checks to confirm eligibility, it has a per-
missible purpose to receive a consumer re-
port.

Section 604(3)(E)—A consumer reporting
agency may issue a consumer report to “a
person which it has reason to believe * * *
otherwise has a legitimate business need for
the information in connection with a busi-
ness transaction involving the consumer.”

1. Relation to Other Subsections of Section
604(3)

The issue of whether credit, employment,
or insurance provides a permissible purpose
is determined exclusively by reference to
subsection (A), (B), or (C), respectively.

2. Commercial Transactions

The term business transaction in this sec-
tion means a business transaction with a
consumer primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes. Business transactions
that involve purely commercial purposes are
not covered by the FCRA.

3. “Legitimate Business Need”

Under this subsection, a party has a per-
missible purpose to obtain a consumer report
on a consumer for use in connection with
some action the consumer takes from which
he or she might expect to receive a benefit
that is not more specifically covered by sub-
sections (A), (B), or (C). For example, a con-
sumer report may be obtained on a consumer
who applies to rent an apartment, offers to
pay for goods with a check, applies for a
checking account or similar service, seeks to
be included in a computer dating service, or
who has sought and received over-payments
of government benefits that he has refused
to return.

4, Litigation

The possibility that a party may be in-
volved in litigation involving a consumer
does not provide a permissible purpose for
that party to receive a consumer report on
such consumer under this subsection, be-
cause litigation is not a “business trans-
action” involving the consumer. Therefore,
potential plaintiffs may not always obtain
reports on potential defendants to determine
whether they are worth suing. The trans-
action that gives rise to the litigation may
or may not provide a permissible purpose. A
party seeking to sue on a credit account
would have a permissible purpose under sec-
tion 604(3)(A). (That section also permits
judgment creditors and lien creditors to ob-
tain consumer reports on judgment debtors
or individuals whose property is subject to
the lien creditor’s lien.) If that transaction
is a business transaction involving the con-
sumer, there is a permissible purpose. If the

Pt. 600, App.

litigation arises from a tort, there is no per-
missible purpose. Similarly, a consumer re-
port may not be obtained solely for use in
discrediting a witness at trial or for locating
a witness. This section does not permit con-
sumer reporting agencies to furnish con-
sumer reports for the purpose of locating a
person suspected of committing a crime. (As
stated in the discussion of section 608 infra
(item 2), section 608 permits the furnishing of
specified, limited identifying information to
governmental agencies, notwithstanding the
provisions of section 604.)

5. Impermissible Purposes

A consumer reporting agency may not fur-
nish a consumer report to satisfy a request-
er’s curiosity, or for use by a news reporter
in preparing a newspaper or magazine arti-
cle.

6. Agents

A. General. An agent? of a party with a
“permissible purpose” may obtain a consumer
report on behalf of his principal, where he is
involved in the decision that gives rise to the
permissible purpose. Such involvement may
include the agent’s making a decision (or
taking action) for the principal, or assisting
the principal in making the decision (e.g., by
evaluating information). In these _ cir-
cumstances, the agent is acting on behalf of
the principal. In some cases, the agent and
principal are referred to as “joint users.” See
discussion in section 603(f), supra (item 8).

B. Real estate agent. A real estate agent
may obtain a consumer report on behalf of a
seller, to evaluate the eligibility as a pro-
spective purchaser of a subject who has ex-
pressed an interest in purchasing property
from the seller.

C. Private detective agency. A private detec-
tive agency may obtain a consumer report as
agent for its client while investigating a re-
port subject that is a client’s prospective
employee, or in connection with advising a
client concerning a business transaction
with the report subject or in attempting to
collect a debt owed its client by the subject
of the report. In these circumstances, the de-
tective agency is acting on behalf of its cli-
ent.

D. Rental clearance agency. A rental clear-
ance agency that obtains consumer reports
to assist owners of residential properties in
screening consumers as tenants, has a per-
missible purpose to obtain the reports, if it
uses them in applying the landlord’s criteria
to approve or disapprove the subjects as ten-
ant applicants. Similarly, an apartment
manager investigating applicants for apart-
ment rentals by a landlord may obtain con-
sumer reports on these applicants.

3O0f course agents and principals are bound
by the Act.

557
Pt. 600, App.

E. Attorney. An attorney collecting a debt
for a creditor client, including a party suing
on a debt or collecting on behalf of a judg-
ment creditor or lien creditor, has a permis-
sible purpose to obtain a consumer report on
the debtor to the same extent as the client.

Section 604—General

1. Furnishing of Consumer Reports to Other
Consumer Reporting Agencies

A consumer reporting agency may furnish
a consumer report to another consumer re-
porting agency for it to furnish pursuant to
a subscriber’s request. In these cir-
cumstances, one consumer reporting agency
is acting on behalf of another.

2. Consumer’s Permission not Needed

When permissible purposes exist, parties
may obtain, and consumer reporting agen-
cies may furnish, consumer reports without
the consumers’ permission or over their ob-
jection. Similarly, parties may furnish infor-
mation concerning their transactions with
consumers to consumer reporting agencies
and others, and consumer reporting agencies
may gather information, without consumers’
permission.

3. User’s Disclosure of Report to Subject
Consumer

The FCRA does not prohibit a consumer
report user from giving a copy of the report,
or othervise disclosing it, to the consumer
who is the subject of the report.

Section 605—Obsolete Information

“(a) Except as authorized under subsection
(b), no consumer reporting agency may make
any consumer report containing any of the fol-
lowing items of information * * *:

(b) The provisions of subsection (a) are not
applicable in the case of any consumer credit re-
port to be used in connection with—

(1) a credit transaction involving, or which
may reasonably be expected to involve, a prin-
cipal amount of $50,000 or more;

(2) the underwriting of life insurance involv-
ing, or which may reasonably be expected to in-
volve, a face amount of $50,000 or more; or

(3) the employment of any individual at an
annual salary which equals, or which may rea-
sonably be expected to equal $20,000, or more.”

1. General

Section 605(a) provides that most adverse
information more than seven years old may
not be reported, except in certain cir-
cumstances set out in section 605(b). With re-
spect to delinquent accounts, accounts
placed for collection, and accounts charged
to profit and loss, there are many dates that
could be deemed to commence seven year re-
porting periods. The discussion in sub-
sections (a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6) is intended to

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

set forth a clear, workable rule that effec-
tuates Congressional intent.

2. Favorable Information

The Act imposes no time restriction on re-
porting of information that is not adverse.

3. Retention of Information in Files

Consumer reporting agencies may retain
obsolete adverse information and furnish it
in reports for purposes that are exempt
under subsection (b) (e.g., credit for a prin-
cipal amount of $50,000 or more).

4. Use of Shorter Periods

The section does not require consumer re-
porting agencies to report adverse informa-
tion for the time periods set forth, but only
prohibits them from reporting adverse items
beyond those time periods.

5. Inapplicability to Users

The section does not limit creditors or oth-
ers from using adverse information that
would be “obsolete” under its terms, because
it applies only to reporting by consumer re-
porting agencies. Similarly, this section does
not bar a creditor’s reporting such adverse
obsolete information concerning its trans-
actions or experiences with a consumer, be-
cause the report would not constitute a con-
sumer report.

6. Indicating the Existence of Nonspecified,
Obsolete Information

A consumer reporting agency may not fur-
nish a consumer report indicating the exist-
ence of obsolete adverse information, even if
no specific item is reported. For example, a
consumer reporting agency may not commu-
nicate the existence of a debt older than
seven years by reporting that a credit grant-
or cannot locate a debtor whose debt was
charged off ten years ago.

7. Operative Dates

The times or dates set forth in this sec-
tion, which relate to the occurrence of
events involving adverse information, deter-
mine whether the item is obsolete. The date
that the consumer reporting agency acquired
the adverse information is irrelevant to how
long that information may be reported.

Section 605(a)(1)—“Cases under title 11 of
the United States Code or under the Bank-
ruptcy Act that, from the date of entry of
the order for relief or the date of adjudica-
tion, as the case may be, antedate the report
by more than 10 years.”

1. Relation to Other Subsections

The reporting of suits and judgments is
governed by subsection (a)(2), the reporting
of accounts placed for collection or charged
to profit and loss is governed by subsection

508
Federal Trade Commission

(a)(4), and the reporting of other delinquent
accounts is governed by subsection (a)(6).
Any such item, even if discharged in bank-
ruptcy, may be reported separately for the
applicable seven year period, while the exist-
ence of the bankruptcy filing may be re-
ported for ten years.

2. Wage Earner Plans

Wage earner plans may be reported for ten
years, because they are covered by Title 11 of
the United States Code.

3. Date for Filing

A voluntary bankruptcy petition may be
reported for ten years from the date that it
is filed, because the filing of the petition
constitutes the entry of an “order for relief”
under this subsection, just like a filing under
the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 301).

Section 605(a)(2)}—“Suits and judgments
which, from date of entry, antedate the re-
port by more than seven years or until the
governing statute of limitations has expired,
whichever is the longer period.”

1. Operative Date

For a suit, the term date of entry means the
date the suit was initiated. A protracted suit
may be reported for more than seven years
from the date it was entered, if the gov-
erning statute of limitations has not expired.
For a judgment, the term “date of entry”
means the date the judgment was rendered.

2. Paid Judgments

Paid judgments cannot be reported for
more than seven years after the judgment
was entered, because payment of the judg-
ment eliminates any “governing statute of
limitations” under this subsection that
might otherwise lengthen the period.

Section 605(a)(3)—“Paid tax liens which,
from date of payment, antedate the report
by more than seven years.”

1. Unpaid Liens

If a tax lien (or other lien) remains
unsatisfied, it may be reported as long as it
remains filed against the consumer, without
limitation, because this subsection addresses
only paid tax liens.

Section 605(a)(4)—“Accounts placed for col-
lection or charged to profit and loss which
antedate the report by more than seven
years.”

1. Placement for Collection

The term placed for collection means inter-
nal collection activity by the creditor, as
well as placement with an outside collector,
whichever occurs first. Sending of the initial
past due notices does not constitute place-
ment for collection. Placement for collection
occurs when dunning notices or other collec-

Pt. 600, App.

tion efforts are initiated. The reporting pe-
riod is not extended by assignment to an-
other entity for further collection, or by a
partial or full payment of the account. How-
ever, where a borrower brings his delinquent
account to date and returns to his regular
payment schedule, and later defaults again,
a consumer reporting agency may disregard
any collection activity with respect to the
first delinquency and measure the reporting
period from the date the account was placed
for collection as a result of the borrower’s
ultimate default. A consumer’s repayment
agreement with a collection agency can be
treated aS a new account that has its own
seven year period.

2. Charge to Profit and Loss

The term charged to profit and loss means
action taken by the creditor to write off the
account, and the applicable time period is
measured from that event. If an account that
was charged off is later paid in part or paid
in full by the consumer, the reporting period
of seven years from the charge-off is not ex-
tended by this subsequent payment.

3. Reporting of a Delinquent Account That is
Later Placed for Collection or Charged to
Profit and Loss

The fact that an account has been placed
for collection or charged to profit and loss
may be reported for seven years from the
date that either of those events occurs, re-
gardless of the date the account became de-
linquent. The fact of delinquency may also
be reported for seven years from the date the
account became delinquent.

Section 605(a)(5)—“Records of arrest, in-
dictment, or conviction of crime which, from
date of disposition, release, or parole, ante-
date the report by more than seven years.”

1. Records

The term records means any information a
consumer reporting agency has in its files re-
lating to arrest, indictment or conviction of
a crime.

2. Computation of Time Period

The seven year reporting period runs from
the date of disposition, release or parole, as
applicable. For example, if charges are dis-
missed at or before trial, or the consumer is
acquitted, the date of such dismissal or ac-
quittal is the date of disposition. If the con-
sumer is convicted of a crime and sentenced
to confinement, the date of release or place-
ment on parole controls. (Confinement,
whether continuing or resulting from revoca-
tion of parole, may be reported until seven
years after the confinement is terminated.)
The sentencing date controls for a convicted
consumer whose sentence does not include
confinement. The fact that information con-
cerning the arrest, indictment, or conviction

559
Pt. 600, App.

of crime is obtained by the reporting agency
at a later date from a more recent source
(such as a newspaper or interview) does not
serve to extend this reporting period.

Section 605(a)(6)—“Any other adverse item
of information which antedates the report by
more than seven years.”

1. Relation to Other Subsections

This section applies to all adverse informa-
tion that is not covered by section 605(a) (1)-
(5). For example, a delinquent account that
has neither been placed for collection, nor
charged to profit and loss, may be reported
for seven years from the date of the last reg-
ularly scheduled payment. (Accounts placed
for collection or charged to profit and loss
may be reported for the time periods stated
in section 605(a)(4).)

2. Non Tax Liens

Liens (other than paid tax liens) may be
reported as long as they remain filed against
the consumer or the consumer’s property,
and remain effective (under any applicable
statute of limitations). (See discussion under
section 605(a)(3), supra.)

Section 606—Disclosure of Investigative
Consumer Reports

“(a) A person may not procure or cause to be
prepared an investigative consumer report on
any consumer unless—

(1) it is clearly and accurately disclosed to
the consumer that an investigative con-
sumer report including information as to his
character, general reputation, personal char-
acteristics, and mode of living, whichever
are applicable, may be made, and such dis-
closure (A) is made in a writing mailed, or
otherwise delivered, to the consumer, not
later than three days after the date on which
the report was first requested, and (B) in-
cludes a statement informing the consumer
of his right to request the additional disclo-
sures provided for under subsection (b) of
this section; or

(2) the report is to be used for employment
purposes for which the consumer has not spe-
cifically applied.

(ob) Any person who procures or causes to
be prepared an investigative consumer report
on any consumer shall, upon written request
made by the consumer within a reasonable
period of time after receipt by him of the
disclosure required by subsection (a)(1),
make a complete and accurate disclosure of
the nature and scope of the investigation re-
quested. This disclosure shall be made in a
writing mailed, or otherwise delivered, to
the consumer not later than five days after
the date on which the request for such dis-
closure was received from the consumer or
such report was first requested, whichever is
the later.

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(c) No person may be held liable for any
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this sec-
tion if he shows by a preponderance of the
evidence that at the time of the violation he
maintained reasonable procedures to assure
compliance with subsection (a) or (b).”

1. Relation to Other Sections

The term investigative consumer report is de-
fined at section 608(e) to mean a consumer
report, all or a portion of which contains in-
formation obtained through personal inter-
views (in person or by telephone) with per-
sons other than the subject, which informa-
tion relates to the subject’s character, gen-
eral reputation, personal characteristics or
mode of living.

2. Inapplicability to Consumer Reporting
Agencies

The section applies only to report users,
not consumer reporting agencies. The FCRA
does not require consumer reporting agen-
cies to inform consumers that information
will be gathered or that reports will be fur-
nished concerning them.

3. Inapplicability to Noninvestigative
Consumer Reports

The section does not apply to noninves-
tigative reports.

4. Exemptions

An employer who orders investigative con-
sumer reports on a current employee who
has not applied for a job change need not no-
tify the employee, because the term “em-
ployment purposes” is defined to include
“promotion, reassignment or retention” and
subsection (b) provides that the disclosure
requirements do not apply to “employment
purposes for which the consumer has not spe-
cifically applied.”

5. Form and Delivery of Notice

The notice must be in writing and deliv-
ered to the consumer. The user may include
the disclosure in an application for employ-
ment, insurance, or credit, if it is clear and
conspicuous and not obscured by other lan-
guage. A user may send the required notice
via first class mail. The notice must be
mailed or otherwise delivered to the con-
sumer not later than three days after the re-
port was first requested.

6. Content of Notice of Right to Disclosure

The notice must clearly and accurately
disclose that an “investigative consumer re-
port” including information as to the con-
sumer’s character, general reputation, per-
sonal characteristics and mode of living
(whichever are applicable), may be made.
The disclosure must also state that an inves-
tigative consumer report involves personal

560
Federal Trade Commission

interviews with sources such as neighbors,
friends, or associates. The notice may in-
clude any additional, accurate information
about the report, such as the types of inter-
views that will be conducted. The notice
must include a statement informing the con-
sumer of the right to request complete and
accurate disclosure of the nature and scope
of the investigation.

7. Content of Disclosure of Report

When the consumer requests disclosure of
the “nature and scope” of the investigation,
such disclosure must include a complete and
accurate description of the types of ques-
tions asked, the number and types of persons
interviewed, and the name and address of the
investigating agency. The user need not dis-
close the names of sources of information,
nor must it provide the consumer with a
copy of the report. A report user that pro-
vides the consumer with a blank copy of the
standardized form used to transmit the re-
port from the agency to the user complies
with the requirement that it disclose the
“nature” of the investigation.

Section 607—Compliance Procedures

“(a) Every consumer reporting agency shall
maintain reasonable procedures designed to
avoid violations of section 605 and to limit
the furnishing of consumer reports to the
purposes listed under section 604. These pro-
cedures shall require that prospective users
of the information identify themselves, cer-
tify the purposes for which the information
is sought, and certify that the information
will be used for no other purpose. Every con-
sumer reporting agency shall make a reason-
able effort to verify the identity of a new
prospective user and the uses certified by
such prospective user prior to furnishing
such user a consumer report. No consumer
reporting agency may furnish a consumer re-
port to any person if it has reasonable
grounds for believing that the consumer re-
port will not be used for a purpose listed in
Section 604.

(b) Whenever a consumer reporting agency
prepares a consumer report it shall follow
reasonable procedures to assure maximum
possible accuracy of the information con-
cerning the individual about whom the re-
port relates.”

1. Procedures To Avoid Reporting Obsolete
Information

A. General. A consumer reporting agency
should establish procedures with its sources
of adverse information that will avoid the
risk of reporting obsolete information. For
example, the agency should either require a
creditor to supply the date an account was
placed for collection or charged off, or the
agency should use a conservative date for
such placement or charge off (such as the

Pt. 600, App.

date of the last regularly scheduled pay-
ment), to be sure of complying with the stat-
ute.

B. Retention of obsolete information for re-
porting in excepted circumstances. If a con-
sumer reporting agency retains adverse in-
formation in its files that is “obsolete” under
section 605(a) (e.g., information about a sat-
isfied judgment that is more than seven
years old), so that it may be reported for use
in transactions described by section 605(b)
(i.e., applications for credit or life insurance
for $50,000 or more, or employment at an an-
nual salary of $20,000 or more), it must have
procedural safeguards to avoid reporting the
information except in those situations. The
procedure should require that such obsolete
information be released only after an inter-
nal decision that its release will not violate
section 605.

2. Procedures To Avoid Reporting for
Impermissible Purposes

A. Verification. A consumer reporting agen-
cy should have a system to verify that it is
dealing with a legitimate business having a
“permissible purpose” for the information re-
ported. What constitutes adequate
verification will vary with the cir-
cumstances. If the consumer reporting agen-
cy is not familiar with the user, appropriate
procedures might require an on-site visit to
the user’s place of business, or a check of the
user’s references.

B. Required certification by user. A consumer
reporting agency should adopt procedures
that require prospective report users to iden-
tify themselves, certify the purpose for
which the information is sought, and certify
that the information will be used for no
other purpose. A consumer reporting agency
should determine initially that users have
permissible purposes and ascertain what
those purposes are. It should obtain a spe-
cific, written certification that the recipient
will obtain reports for those purposes and no
others. The user’s certification that the re-
port will be used for no other purposes
should expressly prohibit the user from shar-
ing the report or providing it to anyone else,
other than the subject of the report or to a
joint user having the same purpose. A con-
sumer reporting agency should refuse to pro-
vide reports to those refusing to provide such
certification.

C. Blanket or individual certification. Once
the consumer reporting agency obtains a cer-
tification from a user (e.g., a creditor) that
typically has a permissible purpose for re-
ceiving a consumer report, stating that it
will use those reports only for specified per-
missible purposes (e.g., for credit or employ-
ment purposes), a certification of purpose
need not be furnished for each individual re-
port obtained, provided there is no reason to
believe the user may be violating its certifi-
cation. However, in furnishing reports to

561
Pt. 600, App.

users that typically could have both permis-
sible and impermissible purposes for order-
ing consumer reports (e.g., attorneys and de-
tective agencies), the consumer reporting
agency must require the user to provide a
separate certification each time it requests a
consumer report.

D. Procedures to avoid recipients’ abuse of
certification. When doubt arises concerning
any user’s compliance with its contractual
certification, a consumer reporting agency
must take steps to insure compliance, such
as requiring a separate, advance certifi-
cation for each report it furnishes that user,
or auditing that user to verify that it is ob-
taining reports only for permissible pur-
poses. A consumer reporting agency must
cease furnishing consumer reports to users
who repeatedly request consumer reports for
impermissible purposes.

E. Unauthorized access. A consumer report-
ing agency should take several other steps
when doubt arises concerning whether a user
is obtaining reports for a permissible purpose
from a computerized system. If it appears
that a third party, not a subscriber, has ob-
tained unauthorized access to the system,
the consumer reporting agency should take
appropriate steps such as altering authorized
users’ means of access, such as codes and
passwords, and making random checks to en-
sure that future reports are obtained only
for permissible purposes. If a subscriber has
inadvertently sought reports for impermis-
sible purposes or its employee has obtained
reports without a permissible purpose, it
would be appropriate for the consumer re-
porting agency to alter the subscriber’s
means of access, and require an individual
written certification of the permissible pur-
pose for each report requested or randomly
verify such purposes. A consumer reporting
agency should refuse to furnish any further
reports to a user that repeatedly violates
certifications.

F. Use of computerized systems. A consumer
reporting agency may furnish consumer re-
ports to users via terminals, provided the
consumer reporting agency has taken the
necessary steps to ensure that the users have
a permissible purpose to receive the reports.
(The agency would have to record the iden-
tity of consumer report recipients for each
consumer, to be able to make any disclosures
required under section 609(a)(3) or section
611(d)).

G. Activity reports. If a consumer reporting
agency provides “activity reports” on all cus-
tomers who have open-end accounts with a
credit grantor, it must make certain that
the credit grantor always notifies the agency
when accounts are closed and paid in full, to
avoid furnishing reports on former cus-
tomers or other customers for whom the
credit grantor lacks a permissible purpose.
(See also discussion in section 604(3)(A), item
1, supra.)

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

3. Reasonable Procedures To Assure
Maximum Possible Accuracy

A. General. The section does not require
error free consumer reports. If a consumer
reporting agency accurately transcribes,
stores and communicates consumer informa-
tion received from a source that it reason-
ably believes to be reputable, and which is
credible on its face, the agency does not vio-
late this section simply by reporting an item
of information that turns out to be inac-
curate. However, when a consumer reporting
agency learns or should reasonably be aware
of errors in its reports that may indicate
systematic problems (by virtue of informa-
tion from consumers, report users, from peri-
odic review of its reporting system, or other-
wise) it must review its procedures for assur-
ing accuracy. Examples of errors that would
require such review are the issuance of a
consumer report pertaining entirely to a
consumer other than the one on whom a re-
port was requested, and the issuance of a
consumer report containing information on
two or more consumers (e.g., information
that was mixed in the file) in response to a
request for a report on only one of those con-
sumers.

B. Required steps to improve accuracy. If the
agency’s review of its procedures reveals, or
the agency should reasonably be aware of,
steps it can take to improve the accuracy of
its reports at a reasonable cost, it must take
any such steps. It should correct inaccura-
cies that come to its attention. A consumer
reporting agency must also adopt reasonable
procedures to eliminate systematic errors
that it knows about, or should reasonably be
aware of, resulting from procedures followed
by its sources of information. For example, if
a particular credit grantor has often fur-
nished a significant amount of erroneous
consumer account information, the agency
must require the creditor to revise its proce-
dures to correct whatever problems cause
the errors or stop reporting information
from that creditor.

C. Use of automatic data processing equip-
ment. Consumer reporting agencies that use
automatic data processing equipment (par-
ticularly for long distance transmission of
information) should have reasonable proce-
dures to assure that the data is accurately
converted into a machine-readable format
and not distorted by machine malfunction or
transmission failure. Reasonable security
procedures must be adopted to minimize the
possibility that computerized consumer in-
formation will be stolen or altered by either
authorized or unauthorized users of the in-
formation system.

D. Reliability of sources. Whether a con-
sumer reporting agency may rely on the ac-
curacy of information from a source depends
on the circumstances. This section does not

562
Federal Trade Commission

hold a consumer reporting agency respon-
sible where an item of information that it re-
ceives from a source that it reasonably be-
lieves to be reputable appears credible on its
face, and is transcribed, stored and commu-
nicated as provided by that source. Require-
ments are more stringent where the informa-
tion furnished appears implausible or incon-
sistent, or where procedures for furnishing it
seem likely to result in inaccuracies, or
where the consumer reporting agency has
had numerous problems regarding informa-
tion from a particular source.

E. Undesignated information in credit trans-
actions. Undesignated information means all
credit history information in a married (or
formerly married) consumer’s file, which was
not reported to the consumer reporting agen-
cy with a designation indicating that the in-
formation relates to either the consumer’s
joint or individual credit experience. The
question arises what is meant by reasonable
procedures under this section for treatment
of credit history in the file of only one
(present or former) spouse (usually the hus-
band) that has not been designated by the
procedure in Regulation B, 12 CFR 202.10,
which implements the Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act. (This situation exists only for
certain credit history file information com-
piled before June 1, 1977, and certain ac-
counts opened before that date.) A consumer
reporting agency may report information
solely in the file of spouse A, when spouse B
applies for a separate extension of credit,
only if such information relates to accounts
for which spouse B was either a user or was
contractually liable, or the report recipient
has a permissible purpose for a report on
spouse A. A consumer reporting agency may
not supply all undesignated information
from the file of a consumer’s spouse in re-
sponse to a request for a report on the con-
sumer, because some or all of that informa-
tion may not relate to both spouses. Con-
sumer reporting agencies must honor with-
out charge the request of a married or for-
merly married individual that undesignated
information (that appears only in the files of
the individual’s present or former spouse) be
segregated—i.e., placed in a separate file
that is accessible under that individual’s
name. This procedure insures greater accu-
racy and protection of the privacy of spouses
than does the automatic reporting of undes-
ignated information.

F. Reporting of credit obligation—(1) Past due
accounts. A consumer reporting agency must
employ reasonable procedures to keep its file
current on past due accounts (e.g., by requir-
ing its creditors to notify the credit bureau
when a previously past due account has been
paid or discharged in bankruptcy), but its
failure to show such activity in particular
instances, despite the maintenance of rea-
sonable procedures to keep files current,
does not violate this section. For example, a

Pt. 600, App.

consumer reporting agency that reports ac-
curately in 1985 that as of 1983 the consumer
owed a retail store money, without men-
tioning that the consumer eventually paid
the debt, does not violate this section if it
was not informed by the store or the con-
sumer of the later payment.

(2) Significant, verified information. A con-
sumer reporting agency must report signifi-
cant, verified information it possesses about
an item. For instance, a consumer reporting
agency may continue to report a paid ac-
count that was previously delinquent, but
should also report that the account has been
paid. Similarly, a consumer reporting agen-
cy may include delinquencies on debts dis-
charged in bankruptcy in consumer reports,
but must accurately note the status of the
debt (e.g., discharged, voluntarily repaid).
Finally, if a reported bankruptcy has been
dismissed, that fact should be reported.

(3) Guarantor obligations. Personal guaran-
tees for obligations incurred by others (in-
cluding a corporation) may be included in a
consumer report on the individual who is the
guarantor. The report should accurately re-
flect the individual’s involvement (e.g., as
guarantor of the corporate debt).

4. Effect of Criminal Sanctions

Notwithstanding the fact that section 619
provides criminal sanctions against persons
who knowingly and willfully obtain informa-
tion on a consumer from a consumer report-
ing agency under false pretenses, a consumer
reporting agency must follow reasonable pro-
cedures to limit the furnishing of reports to
those with permissible purposes.

5. Disclosure of Credit Denial

When reporting that a consumer was de-
nied a benefit (such as credit), a consumer
reporting agency need not report the reasons
for the denial.

6. Content of Report

A consumer report need not be tailored to
the user’s needs. It may contain any infor-
mation that is complete, accurate, and not
obsolete on the consumer who is the subject
of the report. A consumer report may in-
clude an account that was discharged in
bankruptcy (as well as the bankruptcy
itself), as long as it reports a zero balance
due to reflect the fact that the consumer is
no longer liable for the discharged debt. A
consumer report may include a list of recipi-
ents of reports on the consumer who is the
subject of the report.

7. Completeness of Reports

Consumer reporting agencies are not re-
quired to include all existing derogatory or
favorable information about a consumer in
their reports. (See, however, discussion in

563
Pt. 600, App.

section 611, item 14, infra, concerning con-
veying consumer dispute statements.) How-
ever, a consumer reporting agency may not
mislead its subscribers as to the complete-
ness of its reports by deleting nonderogatory
information and not disclosing its policy of
making such deletions.

8. User Notice of Adverse Action Based on a
Consumer Report

A consumer reporting agency need not re-
quire users of its consumer reports to pro-
vide any notice to consumers against whom
adverse action is taken based on a consumer
report. The FCRA imposes such notice re-
quirements directly on users, under the cir-
cumstances set out in section 615.

Section 608—Disclosures to Governmental
Agencies

“Notwithstanding the provisions of section
604, a consumer reporting agency may fur-
nish identifying information respecting any
consumer limited to his name, address,
former addresses, places of employment, or
former places of employment, to a govern-
mental agency.”

1. Permissible Purpose Necessary for
Additional Information

A consumer reporting agency may furnish
limited identifying information concerning a
consumer to a governmental agency (e.g., an
agency seeking a fugitive from justice) even
if that agency does not have a “permissible
purpose” under section 604 to receive a con-
sumer report. However, a governmental
agency must have a permissible purpose in
order to obtain information beyond what is
authorized by this section.

2. Entities Covered by Section

The term governmental agency includes fed-
eral, state, county and municipal agencies,
and grand juries. Only governmental agen-
cies may obtain disclosures of identifying in-
formation under this section.

Section 609—Disclosures to Consumers

“(a) Every consumer reporting agency
shall, upon request and proper identification
of any consumer, clearly and accurately dis-
close to the consumer:

(1) The nature and substance of all infor-
mation (except medical information) in its
files on the consumer at the time of the re-
quest.

(2) The sources of the information; except
that the sources of information acquired
solely for use in preparing an investigative
consumer report and actually used for no
other purpose need not be disclosed: Pro-
vided, That in the event an action is brought
under this title, such sources shall be avail-
able to the plaintiff under appropriate dis-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

covery procedures in the court in which the
action is brought.

(3) The recipients of any consumer report
on the consumer which it has furnished

(A) for employment purposes within the
two-year period preceding the request, and

(B) for any other purpose within the six-
month period preceding the request.

(b) The requirements of subsection (a) re-
specting the disclosure of sources of informa-
tion and the recipients of consumer reports
do not apply to information received or con-
sumer reports furnished prior to the effective
date of this title except to the extent that
the matter involved is contained in the files
of the consumer reporting agency on that
date.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

This section states what consumer report-
ing agencies must disclose to consumers,
upon request and proper identification. Sec-
tion 610 sets forth the conditions under
which those disclosures must be made, and
section 612 sets forth the circumstances
under which consumer reporting agencies
may charge for making such disclosures. The
term “file” as used in section 609(a)(1) is de-
fined in section 603(¢). The term “investiga-
tive consumer report,” which is used in sec-
tion 609(a)(2), is defined in section 6038(e). The
term medical information, which is used in
section 609(a)(1), is defined in section 608(i).

2. Proper Identification

A consumer reporting agency must take
reasonable steps to verify the identity of an
individual seeking disclosure under this sec-
tion.

3. Manner of “Proper Identification”

If a consumer provides sufficient identi-
fying information, the consumer reporting
agency cannot insist that the consumer exe-
cute a “request for interview” form, or pro-
vide the items listed on it, as a prerequisite
to disclosure. However, the agency may use
a form to identify consumers requesting dis-
closure if it does not use the form to inhibit
disclosure, or to obtain any waiver of the
consumers’ rights. A consumer reporting
agency may provide disclosure by telephone
without a written request, if the consumer is
properly identified, but may insist on a writ-
ten request before providing such disclosure.

4. Power of Attorney

A consumer reporting agency may disclose
a consumer’s file to a third party authorized
by the consumer’s written power of attorney
to obtain the disclosure, if the third party
presents adequate identification and fulfills
other applicable conditions of disclosure.
However, the agency may also disclose the
information directly to the consumer.

564
Federal Trade Commission

5. Nature of Disclosure Required

A consumer reporting agency must dis-
close the nature and substance of all items
in the consumer’s file, no matter how or
where they are stored (e.g., in other offices
of the consumer reporting agency). The con-
sumer reporting agency must have personnel
trained to explain to the consumer any infor-
mation furnished in accordance with the
Act. Particularly when the file includes
coded information that would be meaning-
less to the consumer, the agency’s personnel
must assist the consumer to understand the
disclosures. Any summary must not
mischaracterize the nature of any item of in-
formation in the file. The consumer report-
ing agency is not required to provide a copy
of the file, or any other written disclosure,
or to read the file verbatim to the consumer
or to permit the consumer to examine any
information in its files. A consumer report-
ing agency may choose to usually comply
with the FCRA in writing, by providing a
copy of the file to the consumer or other-
wise.

6. Medical Information

Medical information includes information
obtained with the consumer’s consent from
physicians and medical facilities, but does
not include comments on a consumer’s
health by non-medical personnel. A con-
sumer reporting agency is not required to
disclose medical information in its files to
consumers, but may do so. Alternatively, a
consumer reporting agency may inform con-
sumers that there is medical information in
the files concerning them and supply the
name of the doctor or other source of the in-
formation. Consumer reporting agencies may
also disclose such information to a physician
of the consumer’s choice, upon the con-
sumer’s written instructions pursuant to
section 604(2).

7. Ancillary Information.

A consumer reporting agency is not re-
quired to disclose information consisting of
an audit trail of changes it makes in the con-
sumer’s file, billing records, or the contents
of a consumer relations folder, if the infor-
mation is not from consumer reports and
will not be used in preparing future con-
sumer reports. Such data is not included in
the term “information in the files” which
must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant
to this section. A consumer reporting agency
must disclose claims report information only
if it has appeared in consumer reports.

8. Information on Other Consumers

The consumer has no right to information
in the consumer reporting agency’s files on
other individuals, because the disclosure
must be limited to information “on the con-

Pt. 600, App.

sumer.” However, all information in the files
of the consumer making the request must be
disclosed, including information about an-
other individual that relates to the con-
sumer (e.g., concerning that individual’s
dealings with the subject of the consumer re-
port).

9. Disclosure of Sources of Information

Consumer reporting agencies must disclose
the sources of information, except for
sources of information acquired solely for
use in preparing an investigative consumer
report and actually used for no other pur-
pose. When it has used information from an-
other consumer reporting agency, the other
agency should be reported as a source.

10. Disclosure of Recipients of Consumer
Reports

Consumer reporting agencies must main-
tain records of recipients of prior consumer
reports sufficient to enable them to meet the
FCRA’s requirements that they disclose the
identity of recipients of prior consumer re-
ports. A consumer reporting agency that fur-
nishes a consumer report directly to a report
user at the request of another consumer re-
porting agency must disclose the identity of
the user that was the ultimate recipient of
the report, not the other agency that acted
as an intermediary in procuring the report.

11. Disclosure of Recipients of Prescreened
Lists

A consumer reporting agency must furnish
to a consumer requesting file disclosure the
identity of recipients of any prescreened
lists that contained the consumer’s name
when submitted to creditors (or other users)
by the consumer reporting agency.

12. Risk Scores.

A consumer reporting agency is not re-
quired to disclose a risk score (or other nu-
merical evaluation, however named) that is
provided to the agency’s client (based on an
analysis of data on the consumer) but not re-
tained by the agency. Such a score is not in-
formation “in (the agency’s) files at the time
of the request” by the consumer for file dis-
closure.

Section 610—Conditions of Disclosure

“(a) A consumer reporting agency shall
make the disclosures required under section
609 during normal business hours and on rea-
sonable notice.

(ob) The disclosures required under section
609 shall be made to the consumer—

(1) in person if he appears in person and
furnishes proper identification; or

(2) by telephone if he has made a written
request, with proper identification, for tele-
phone disclosure and the toll charge, if any,

565
Pt. 600, App.

for the telephone call is prepaid by or
charged directly to the consumer.

(c) Any consumer reporting agency shall
provide trained personnel to explain to the
consumer any information furnished to him
pursuant to section 609.

(d) The consumer shall be permitted to be
accompanied by one other person of his
choosing, who shall furnish reasonable iden-
tification. A consumer reporting agency may
require the consumer to furnish a written
statement granting permission to the con-
sumer reporting agency to discuss the con-
sumer’s file in such person’s presence.

(e) Except as provided in section 616 and
617, no consumer may bring any action or
proceeding in the nature of defamation, in-
vasion of privacy, or negligence with respect
to the reporting of information against any
consumer reporting agency, any user of in-
formation or any person who furnishes infor-
mation to a consumer reporting agency,
based on information disclosed pursuant to
section 609, 610, or 615, except as to false in-
formation furnished with malice or willful
intent to injure such consumers.”

1. Time of Disclosure

A consumer reporting agency must make
disclosures during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice. However, the con-
sumer reporting agency may waive reason-
able notice, and the consumer may agree to
disclosure outside of normal business hours.
A consumer reporting agency may make in-
person disclosure to consumers who have
made appointments ahead of other con-
sumers, because the disclosures are only re-
quired to be made “on reasonable notice.”

2. Extra Conditions Prohibited

A consumer reporting agency may not add
conditions not set out in the FCRA as a pre-
requisite to the required disclosure.

3. Manner of Disclosure

A consumer reporting agency may, with
the consumer’s actual or implied consent,
meet its disclosure obligations by mail, in
lieu of the in-person or telephone disclosures
specified in the statute.

4. Disclosure in the Presence of Third Parties

When the consumer requests disclosure in
a third party’s presence, the consumer re-
porting agency may require that a consumer
sign an authorization before such disclosure
is made. The consumer may choose the third
party to accompany him or her for the dis-
closure.

5. Expense of Telephone Calls

A consumer reporting agency is not re-
quired to pay the telephone charge for a tele-
phone interview with a consumer obtaining
disclosure.

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

6. Qualified Defamation Privilege

The privilege extended by subsection 610(e)
does not apply to an action brought by a con-
sumer if the action is based on information
not disclosed pursuant to sections 609, 610 or
615. A disclosure to a consumer’s representa-
tive (e.g., based on the consumer’s power of
attorney) constitutes “information disclosed
pursuant to section 609” and is thus covered
by this privilege.

Section 611—Procedure in Case of Disputed
Accuracy

“(a) If the completeness or accuracy of any
item of information contained in his file is
disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is
directly conveyed to the consumer reporting
agency by the consumer, the consumer re-
porting agency shall within a reasonable pe-
riod of time reinvestigate and record the cur-
rent status of that information unless it has
reasonable grounds to believe that the dis-
pute by the consumer is frivolous or irrele-
vant. If after such reinvestigation such infor-
mation is found to be inaccurate or can no
longer be verified, the consumer reporting
agency shall promptly delete such informa-
tion. The presence of contradictory informa-
tion in the consumer’s file does not in and of
itself constitute reasonable grounds for be-
lieving the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.

(b) If the reinvestigation does not resolve
the dispute, the consumer may file a brief
statement setting forth the nature of the
dispute. The consumer reporting agency may
limit such statements to not more than one
hundred words if it provides the consumer
with assistance in writing a clear summary
of the dispute.

(c) Whenever a statement of a dispute is
filed, unless there is reasonable grounds to
believe that it is frivolous or irrelevant, the
consumer reporting agency shall, in any sub-
sequent consumer report containing the in-
formation in question, clearly note that it is
disputed by the consumer and provide either
the consumer’s statement or a clear and ac-
curate codification or summary thereof.

(d) Following any deletion of information
which is found to be inaccurate or whose ac-
curacy can no longer be verified or any nota-
tion as to disputed information, the con-
sumer reporting agency shall, at the request
of the consumer, furnish notification that
the item has been deleted or the statement,
codification or summary pursuant to sub-
section (b) or (c) to any person specifically
designated by the consumer who has within
two years prior thereto received a consumer
report for employment purposes, or within
six months prior thereto received a con-
sumer report for any other purpose, which
contained the deleted or disputed informa-
tion. The consumer reporting agency shall
clearly and conspicuously disclose to the
consumer his rights to make such a request.

566
Federal Trade Commission

Such disclosure shall be made at or prior to
the time the information is deleted or the
consumer’s statement regarding the disputed
information is received.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

This section sets forth procedures con-
sumer reporting agencies must follow if a
consumer conveys a dispute of the complete-
ness or accuracy of any item of information
in the consumer’s file to the consumer re-
porting agency. Section 609 provides for dis-
closures by consumer reporting agencies to
consumers, and section 610 sets forth condi-
tions of disclosure. Section 612 permits a
consumer reporting agency to impose
charges for certain disclosures, including the
furnishing of certain information to recipi-
ents of prior reports, as provided by section
611(d).

2. Proper Reinvestigation

A consumer reporting agency conducting a
reinvestigation must make a good faith ef-
fort to determine the accuracy of the dis-
puted item or items. At a minimum, it must
check with the original sources or other reli-
able sources of the disputed information and
inform them of the nature of the consumer’s
dispute. In reinvestigating and attempting
to verify a disputed credit transaction, a
consumer reporting agency may rely on the
accuracy of a creditor’s ledger sheets and
need not require the creditor to produce doc-
umentation such as the actual signed sales
slips. Depending on the nature of the dis-
pute, reinvestigation and verification may
require more than asking the original source
of the disputed information the same ques-
tion and receiving the same answer. If the
original source is contacted for reinvestiga-
tion, the consumer reporting agency should
at least explain to the source that the origi-
nal statement has been disputed, state the
consumer’s position, and then ask whether
the source would confirm the information,
qualify it, or accept the consumer’s expla-
nation.

3. Complaint of Insufficient File, or Lack of
File

The FCRA does not require a consumer re-
porting agency to add new items of informa-
tion to its file. A consumer reporting agency
is not required to create new files on con-
sumers for whom it has no file, nor is it re-
quired to add new lines of information about
new accounts not reflected in an existing
file, because the section permits the con-
sumer to dispute only the completeness or
accuracy of particular items of information
in the file. If a consumer reporting agency
chooses to add lines of information at the
consumer’s request, it may charge a fee for
doing so.

Pt. 600, App.

4, Explanation of Extenuating Circumstances

A consumer reporting agency has no duty
to reinvestigate, or take any other action
under this section, if a consumer merely pro-
vides a reason for a failure to pay a debt
(e.g., sudden illness or layoff), and does not
challenge the accuracy or completeness of
the item of information in the file relating
to a debt. Most creditors are aware that a
variety of circumstances may render con-
sumers unable to repay credit obligations.
Although a consumer reporting agency is not
required to accept a consumer dispute state-
ment that does not challenge the accuracy
or completeness of an item in the consumer’s
file, it may accept such a statement and may
charge a fee for doing so.

5. Reinvestigation of a Debt

A consumer reporting agency must re-
investigate if a consumer conveys to it a dis-
pute concerning the validity or status of a
debt, such as whether the debt was owed by
the consumer, or whether the debt had sub-
sequently been paid. For example, if a con-
sumer alleges that a judgment reflected in
the file as unpaid has been satisfied, or noti-
fies a consumer reporting agency that a past
due obligation reflected in the file as unpaid
was subsequently paid, the consumer report-
ing agency must reinvestigate the matter. If
a file reflects a debt discharged in bank-
ruptcy without reflecting subsequent reaffir-
mation and payment of that debt, a con-
sumer may require that the item be reinves-
tigated.

6. Status of a Debt

The consumer reporting agency must, upon
reinvestigation, “record the current status”
of the disputed item. This requires inclusion
of any information relating to a change in
status of an ongoing matter (e.g., that a
credit account had been closed, that a debt
shown as past due had subsequently been
paid or discharged in bankruptcy, or that a
debt shown as discharged in bankruptcy was
later reaffirmed and/or paid).

7. Dispute Conveyed to Party Other Than the
Consumer Reporting Agency

A consumer reporting agency is required to
take action under this section only if the
consumer directly communicates a dispute
to it. It is not required to respond to a dis-
pute of information that the consumer mere-
ly conveys to others (e.g., to a source of in-
formation). (But see, however, discussion in
section 607, item 8A, of consumer reporting
agencies’ duties to correct errors that come
to their attention.)

567
Pt. 600, App.

8. Dispute Conveyed to the Consumer Re-
porting Agency by a Party Other Than the
Consumer

A consumer reporting agency need not re-
investigate a dispute about a consumer’s file
raised by any third party, because the obli-
gation under the section arises only where
an “item of information in his file is disputed
by the consumer.”

9. Consumer Disclosures and Adverse Action
Not Prerequisites to Reinvestigation Duty

A consumer reporting agency’s obligation
to reinvestigate disputed items is not contin-
gent upon the consumer’s having been denied
a benefit or having asserted any rights under
the FCRA other than disputing items of in-
formation.

10. Reasonable Period of Time

A consumer reporting agency is required to
reinvestigate and record the current status
of disputed information within a reasonable
period of time after the consumer conveys
the dispute to it. Although consumer report-
ing agencies are able to reinvestigate most
disputes within 30 days, a “reasonable time”
for a particular reinvestigation may be
shorter or longer depending on the cir-
cumstances of the dispute. For example,
where the consumer provides documentary
evidence (e.g., a certified copy of a court
record to show that a judgment has been
paid) when submitting the dispute, the cred-
itor may require a shorter time to reinves-
tigate. On the other hand, where the dispute
is more complicated than normal (e.g., the
consumer alleges in good faith that a cred-
itor has falsified its report of the consumer’s
account history because of a _ personal
grudge), the “reasonable time” needed to con-
duct the reinvestigation may be longer.

11. Frivolous or Irrelevant

The mere presence of contradictory infor-
mation in the file does not provide the con-
sumer reporting agency “reasonable grounds
to believe that the dispute by the consumer
is frivolous or irrelevant.” A consumer re-
porting agency must assume a consumer’s
dispute is bona fide, unless there is evidence
to the contrary. Such evidence may con-
stitute receipt of letters from consumers dis-
puting all information in their files without
providing any allegations concerning the
specific items in the files, or of several let-
ters in similar format that indicate that a
particular third party (e.g., a “credit repair”
operator) is counselling consumers to dis-
pute all items in their files, regardless of
whether the information is known to be ac-
curate. The agency is not required to repeat
a reinvestigation that it has previously con-
ducted simply because the consumer reiter-
ates a dispute about the same item of infor-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

mation, unless the consumer provides addi-
tional evidence that the item is inaccurate
or incomplete, or alleges changed  cir-
cumstances.

12. Deletion of Accurate Information That
has not Been Disputed

The consumer reporting agency is not re-
quired to delete accurate information that
could not be verified upon reinvestigation, if
it has not been “disputed by a consumer.” For
example, if a creditor deletes adverse infor-
mation from its files with the result that in-
formation could not be reverified if disputed,
it is still permissible for a consumer report-
ing agency to report it (subject to the obso-
lescence provisions of section 605) until it is
disputed.

13. Consumer Dispute Statements on
Multiple Items

A consumer who disputes multiple items of
information in his file may submit a one
hundred word statement as to each disputed
item.

14. Conveying Dispute Statements to
Recipients of Subsequent Reports.

A consumer reporting agency may not
merely tell the recipient of a subsequent re-
port containing disputed information that
the consumer’s statement is on file but will
be provided only if requested, because sub-
section (c) requires the agency to provide ei-
ther the statement or “a clear and accurate
codification or summary thereof.”

Section 612—Charges for Certain Disclosures

“A consumer reporting agency shall make
all disclosures pursuant to section 609 and
furnish all consumer reports pursuant to sec-
tion 611(d) without charge to the consumer
if, within thirty days after receipt by such
consumer of a notification pursuant to sec-
tion 615 or notification from a debt collec-
tion agency affiliated with such consumer
reporting agency stating that the con-
sumer’s credit rating may be or has been ad-
versely affected, the consumer makes a re-
quest under section 609 or 611(d). Otherwise,
the consumer reporting agency may impose
a reasonable charge on the consumer for
making disclosure to such consumer pursu-
ant to section 609, the charge for which shall
be indicated to the consumer prior to mak-
ing disclosure; and for furnishing notifica-
tions, statements, summaries, or codifica-
tions to persons designated by the consumer
pursuant to section 611(d), the charge for
which shall be indicated to the consumer
prior to furnishing such information and
shall not exceed the charge that the con-
sumer reporting agency would impose on
each designated recipient for a consumer re-
port except that no charge may be made for

568
Federal Trade Commission

notifying such persons of the deletion of in-
formation which is found to be inaccurate or
which can no longer be verified.”

1. Irrelevance of Subsequent Grant of Credit
or Reason for Denial

A consumer denied credit because of a con-
sumer report from a consumer reporting
agency has the right to a free disclosure
from that agency within 30 days of receipt of
the section 615(a) notice, even if credit was
subsequently granted or the basis of the de-
nial was that the references supplied by the
consumer are too few or too new to appear in
the credit file.

2. Charge for Reinvestigation Prohibited

This section does not permit consumer re-
porting agencies to charge for making the
reinvestigation or following other proce-
dures required by section 611 (a)-(c).

3. Permissible Charges for Services
Requested by Consumers

A consumer reporting agency may charge
fees for creating files on consumers at their
request, or for other services not required by
the FCRA that are requested by consumers.

Section 613—Public Record Information for
Employment Purposes

“A consumer reporting agency which fur-
nishes a consumer report for employment
purposes and which for that purpose com-
piles and reports items of information on
consumers which are matters of public
record and are likely to have an adverse ef-
fect upon a consumer’s ability to obtain em-
ployment shall—

(1) at the time such public record informa-
tion is reported to the user of such consumer
report, notify the consumer of the fact that
public record information is being reported
by the consumer reporting agency, together
with the name and address of the person to
whom such information is being reported; or

(2) maintain strict procedures designed to
insure that whenever public record informa-
tion which is likely to have an adverse effect
on a consumer’s ability to obtain employ-
ment is reported it is complete and up to
date. For purposes of this paragraph, items
of public record relating to arrests, indict-
ments, convictions, suits, tax liens, and out-
standing judgments shall be considered up to
date if the current public record status of
the item at the time of the report is re-
ported.”

1. Relation to Other Sections

A consumer reporting agency that com-
plies with section 613(1) must also follow rea-
sonable procedures to assure maximum pos-
sible accuracy, as required by section 607(b).

Pt. 600, App.

2. Alternate Methods of Compliance

A consumer reporting agency that fur-
nishes public record information for employ-
ment purposes must comply with either sub-
section (1) or (2), but need not comply with
both.

3. Information From Another Consumer
Reporting Agency

If a consumer reporting agency uses infor-
mation or reports from other consumer re-
porting agencies in a report for employment
purposes, it must comply with this section.

4. Method of Providing Notice

A consumer reporting agency may use first
class mail to provide the notice required by
subsection (1).

5. Waiver

The procedures required by this section
cannot be waived by the consumer to whom
the report relates.

Section 614—Restrictions on Investigative
Consumer Reports

“Whenever a consumer reporting agency
prepares an investigative consumer report,
no adverse information in the consumer re-
port (other than information which is a mat-
ter of public record) may be included in a
subsequent consumer report unless such ad-
verse information has been verified in the
process of making such subsequent consumer
report, or the adverse information was re-
ceived within the three-month period pre-
ceding the date the subsequent report is fur-
nished.”

Section 615—Requirements on Users of
Consumer Reports

(a) Whenever credit or insurance for per-
sonal, family, or household purposes, or em-
ployment involving a consumer is denied or
the charge for such credit or insurance is in-
creased either wholly or partly because of in-
formation contained in a consumer report
from a consumer reporting agency, the user
of the consumer report shall so advise the
consumer against whom such adverse action
has been taken and supply the name and ad-
dress of the consumer reporting agency mak-
ing the report.

(ob) Whenever credit for personal, family, or
household purposes involving a consumer is
denied or the charge for such credit is in-
creased either wholly or partly because of in-
formation obtained from a person other than
a consumer reporting agency bearing upon
the consumer’s credit worthiness, credit
standing, credit capacity, character, general
reputation, personal characteristics, or mode
of living, the user of such information shall,
within a reasonable period of time, upon the
consumer’s written request for the reasons

569
Pt. 600, App.

for such adverse action received within 60
days after learning of such adverse action,
disclose the nature of the information to the
consumer. The user of such information shall
clearly and accurately disclose to the con-
sumer his right to make such written re-
quest at the time such adverse action is com-
municated to the consumer.

(c) No person shall be held liable for any
violation of this section if he shows by a pre-
ponderance of the evidence that at the time
of the alleged violation he maintained rea-
sonable procedures to assure compliance
with the provisions of subsections (a) and
(b).”

1. Relation to Other Sections and Regulation
B

Sections 606 and 615 are the only two sec-
tions that require users of reports to make
disclosures to consumers. Section 606 applies
only to users of “investigative consumer re-
ports.” Creditors should not confuse compli-
ance with section 615(a), which only requires
disclosure of the name and address of the
consumer reporting agency, and compliance
with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15
U.S.C. 1691 et seq. and Regulation B, 12 CFR
202, which require disclosure of the reasons
for adverse action. Compliance with section
615(a), therefore, does not constitute compli-
ance with Regulation B.

2. Limited Scope of Requirements

The section does not require that creditors
disclose their credit criteria or standards or
that employees furnish copies of personnel
files to former employees. The section does
not require that the user provide any kind of
advance notification to consumers before a
consumer report is obtained. (See section 606
regarding notice of investigative consumer
reports.)

3. Method of Disclosure

The disclosures required by this section
need not be made in writing. However, users
will have evidence that they have taken rea-
sonable steps to comply with this section if
they provide written disclosures and retain
copies for at least two years, the applicable
statute of limitations for most civil liability
actions under the FCRA.

4, Adverse Action Based on Direct
Information

This section does not require that a user
send any notice to a consumer concerning
adverse action regarding that consumer that
is based neither on information from a con-
sumer reporting agency nor on information
from a third party. For example, no disclo-
sures are required concerning adverse action
based on information provided by the con-
sumer in an application or based on past ex-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

perience in direct transactions with the con-
sumer.

5. Creditors Using “Prescreened” Mailing
Lists

A creditor is not required to provide no-
tices regarding consumer reporting agencies
that prepare mailing lists by “prescreening”
because they do not involve consumer re-
quests for credit and credit has not been de-
nied to consumers whose names are deleted
from a list furnished to the agency for use in
this procedure. See discussion of
“prescreening,” under section 604(3)(A), item
6, supra.

6. Applicability to Users of Motor Vehicle
Reports

An insurer that refuses to issue a policy, or
charges a higher than normal premium,
based on a motor vehicle report is required
to comply with subsection(a).

7. Securities and Insurance Transactions

A consumer report user that denies credit
to a consumer in connection with a securi-
ties transaction must provide the required
notice, because the denial is of “cred-
it * * * for personal purposes,” unless the
consumer engages in such transactions as a
business.

8. Denial of Employment

An employer must provide the notice re-
quired by subsection (a) to an individual who
has applied for employment and has been re-
jected based on a consumer report. However,
an employer is not required to send a notice
when it decides not to offer a position to an
individual who has not applied for it, because
in this case employment is not “denied.” (See
discussion in section 606, item 4, supra.)

9, Adverse Action Involving Credit

A creditor must provide the required no-
tice when it denies the consumer’s request
for credit (including a rejection based on a
scoring system, where a credit report re-
ceived less than the maximum number of
points possible and caused the application to
receive an insufficient score), denies the con-
sumer’s request for increased credit, grants
credit in an amount less than the consumer
requested, or raises the charge for credit.

10. Adverse Action Not Involving Credit,
Insurance or Employment

The Act does not require that a report user
provide any notice to consumers when tak-
ing adverse action not relating to credit, in-
surance or employment. For example, a land-
lord who refuses to rent an apartment to a
consumer based on credit or other informa-
tion in a consumer report need not provide

570
Federal Trade Commission

the notice. Similarly, a party that uses cred-
it or other information in a consumer report
as a basis for refusing to accept payment by
check need not comply with this section.
Checks have historically been treated as
cash items, and thus such refusal does not
involve a denial of credit, insurance or em-
ployment.

11. Adverse Action Based on Non-derogatory
Adverse Information

A party taking adverse action concerning
credit or insurance or denying employment,
“wholly or partly because of information
contained in a consumer report,” must pro-
vide the required notice, even if the informa-
tion is not derogatory. For example, the user
must give the notice if the denial is based
wholly or partly on the absence of a file or
on the fact that the file contained insuffi-
cient references.

12. Name and Address of the Consumer
Reporting Agency

The “section 615(a)” notice must include
the consumer reporting agency’s street ad-
dress, not just a post office box address.

13. Agency To Be Identified

The consumer report user should provide
the name and address of the consumer re-
porting agency from which it obtained the
consumer report, even if that agency ob-
tained all or part of the report from another
agency.

14. Denial Based Partly on a Consumer
Report

A “section 615(a)” notice must be sent even
if the adverse action is based only partly on
a consumer report.

15. Denial of Credit Based on Information
From “Third Parties”

Subsection (b) imposes requirements on a
creditor when it denies (or increases the
charge for) credit for personal, family or
household purposes involving a consumer,
based on information from a “third party”
source, which means a source other than the
consumer reporting agency, the creditor’s
own files, or the consumer’s application (e.g.,
creditor, employer, landlord, or the public
record). Where a creditor denies a con-
sumer’s application based on information ob-
tained directly from another lender, even if
the lender’s name was furnished to the cred-
itor by a consumer reporting agency, the
creditor must give a “third party” disclosure.

16. Substance of Required “Third Party”
Disclosures

When the adverse action is communicated
to the consumer, the creditor must clearly
and accurately disclose to the consumer his

Pt. 600, App.

or her right to make a written request for
the disclosure of the nature of the third
party information that led to the adverse ac-
tion. Upon timely receipt of such a request,
however, the creditor need disclose only the
nature of the information that led to the ad-
verse action (e.g., history of late rent pay-
ments or bad checks); it need not identify
the source that provided the information or
the criteria that led to the adverse action. A
creditor may comply with subsection (b) by
providing a statement of the nature of the
third party information that led to the de-
nial when it notifies the consumer of the de-
nial. A statement of principal, specific rea-
sons for adverse action based on third party
information that is sufficient to comply with
the requirements of the Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act (e.g., “unable to verify employ-
ment”) is sufficient to constitute disclosure
of the “nature of the information” under sub-
section (b).

Section 616—Civil Liability for Willful
Noncompliance

Section 616 permits consumers who sue and
prove willful noncompliance with the Act to
recover actual damages, punitive damages,
and the costs of the action, together with
reasonable attorney’s fees.

Section 617—Civil Liability for Negligent
Noncompliance

Section 617 permits consumers who sue and
prove negligent noncompliance with the Act
to recover actual damages and the costs of
the action, together with reasonable attor-
ney’s fees.

Section 618—Jurisdiction of Courts; Limitation
of Actions

Section 618 provides that any action
brought under section 616 or section 617 may
be brought in any United States district
court or other court of competent jurisdic-
tion. Such suit must be brought within two
years from the date on which liability arises,
unless a defendant has materially and will-
fully misrepresented information the Act re-
quires to be disclosed, and the information
misrepresented is material to establishment
of the defendant’s liability. In that event,
the action must be brought within two years
after the individual discovers the misrepre-
sentation.

Section 619—Obtaining Information Under False
Pretense

Section 619 provides criminal sanctions
against any person who knowingly and will-
fully obtains information on a consumer
from a consumer reporting agency under
false pretenses.

571
Pt. 600, App.

1. Relation to Other Sections

The presence of this provision does not ex-
cuse a consumer reporting agency’s failure
to follow reasonable procedures, as required
by section 607(a), to limit the furnishing of
consumer reports to the purposes listed
under section 604.

Section 620—Unauthorized Disclosures by
Officers or Employees

Section 620 provides criminal sanctions
against any officer or employee of a con-
sumer reporting agency who knowingly and
willfully provides information concerning an
individual from the agency’s file to a person
not authorized to receive it.

Section 621—Administrative Enforcement

This section gives the Federal Trade Com-
mission authority to enforce the Act with re-
spect to consumer reporting agencies, users
of reports, and all others, except to the ex-
tent that it gives enforcement jurisdiction
specifically to some other agency. Those ex-
cepted from the Commission’s enforcement
jurisdiction include certain financial institu-
tions regulated by Federal agencies or
boards, Federal credit unions, common car-
riers subject to acts to regulate commerce,
air carriers, and parties subject to the Pack-
ers and Stockyards Act, 1921.

1. General

The Commission can use its cease-and-de-
sist power and other procedural, investiga-
tive and enforcement powers which it has
under the FTC Act to secure compliance, ir-
respective of commerce or any other juris-
dictional tests in the FTC Act.

2. Geographic Coverage

The Commission’s authority encompasses
the United States, the District of Columbia,
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and all
United States territories but does not extend
to activities outside those areas.

3. Status of Commission Commentary and
Staff Interpretations

The FCRA does not give any Federal agen-
cy authority to promulgate rules having the
force and effect, of statutory provisions. The
Commission has issued this Commentary, su-
perseding the eight formal Interpretations of
the Act (16 CFR 600.1-600.8), previously issued
pursuant to §1.78 of the Commission’s Rules,
16 CFR 1.73. The Commentary does not con-
stitute substantive rules and does not have
the force or effect of statutory provisions. It
constitutes guidelines to clarify the Act that
are advisory in nature and represent the
Commission’s views as to what particular
provisions of the Act mean. Staff opinion let-
ters constitute staff interpretations of the
Act’s provisions, but do not have the force or

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

effect of statutory provisions and, as pro-
vided in §1.72 of the Commission’s Rules, 16
CFR 1.72, do not bind the Commission.

Section 622—Relation to State Laws

“This title does not annul, alter, affect, or
exempt any person subject to the provisions
of this title from complying with the laws of
any State with respect to the collection, dis-
tribution, or use of any information on con-
sumers, except to the extent that those laws
are inconsistent with any provision of this
title, and then only to the extent of the in-
consistency.”

1. Basic Rule

State law is pre-empted by the FCRA only
when compliance with inconsistent State
law would result in violation of the FCRA.

2. Examples of Statutes that are not Pre-
empted

A State law requirement that an employer
provide notice to a consumer before ordering
a consumer report, or that a consumer re-
porting agency must provide the consumer
with a written copy of his file, would not be
pre-empted, because a party that complies
with such provisions would not violate the
FCRA.

3. Examples of Statutes that are Pre-empted

A State law authorizing grand juries to
compel consumer reporting agencies to pro-
vide consumer reports, by means of sub-
poenas signed by a court clerk, is pre-empted
by the FCRA’s requirement that such reports
be furnished only pursuant to an “order of
the court” signed by a judge (section 604(1)),
or furnished for other purposes not applica-
ble to grand jury subpoenas (section 604 (2)-
(3)), and by section 607(a). A State statute re-
quiring automatic disclosure of a deletion or
dispute statement to every person who has
previously received a consumer report con-
taining the disputed information, regardless
of whether the consumer designates such
persons to receive this disclosure, is pre-
empted by section 604 of the FCRA, which
permits disclosure only for specified, permis-
sible purposes and by section 607(a), which
requires consumer reporting agencies to
limit the furnishing of consumer reports to
purposes listed under section 604. Absent a
specific designation by the consumer, the
consumer reporting agency has no reason to
believe all past recipients would have a
present, permissible purpose to receive the
reports.

4, Statute Providing Access for Enforcement
Purposes

A State “little FCRA” that permits State
officials access to a consumer reporting
agency’s files for the purpose of enforcing

572
Federal Trade Commission

that statute just as Federal agencies are per-
mitted access to such files under the FCRA,
is not pre-empted by the FCRA.

§603.1 [Reserved]

§603.2 Identity theft.

(a) The term “identity theft” means a fraud
committed or attempted using the identi-
fying information of another person without
authority.

(b) The term “identifying information”
means any name or number that may be
used, alone or in conjunction with any other
information, to identify a specific person, in-
cluding any—

(1) Name, social security number, date of
birth, official State or government issued
driver’s license or identification number,
alien registration number, government pass-
port number, employer or taxpayer identi-
fication number;

(2) Unique biometric data, such as finger-
print, voice print, retina or iris image, or
other unique physical representation;

(3) Unique electronic identification num-
ber, address, or routing code; or

(4) Telecommunication identifying infor-
mation or access device (as defined in 18
U.S.C. 1029(e)).

§603.3 Identity theft report.

(a) The term “identity theft report” means
a report—

(1) That alleges identity theft with as
much specificity as the consumer can pro-
vide;

(2) That is a copy of an official, valid re-
port filed by the consumer with a Federal,
State, or local law enforcement agency, in-
cluding the United States Postal Inspection
Service, the filing of which subjects the per-
son filing the report to criminal penalties re-
lating to the filing of false information, if, in

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

fact, the information in the report is false;
and

(3) That may include additional informa-
tion or documentation that an information
furnisher or consumer reporting agency rea-
sonably requests for the purpose of deter-
mining the validity of the alleged identity
theft, provided that the information fur-
nisher or consumer reporting agency:

(i) Makes such request not later than fif-
teen days after the date of receipt of the
copy of the report form identified in para-
graph (a)(2) of this section or the request by
the consumer for the particular service,
whichever shall be the later;

(ii) Makes any supplemental requests for
information or documentation and final de-
termination on the acceptance of the iden-
tity theft report within another fifteen days
after its initial request for information or
documentation; and

(iii) Shall have five days to make a final
determination on the acceptance of the iden-
tity theft report, in the event that the con-
sumer reporting agency or information fur-
nisher receives any such additional informa-
tion or documentation on the eleventh day
or later within the fifteen day period set
forth in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.

(b) Examples of the specificity referenced
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are pro-
vided for illustrative purposes only, as fol-
lows:

(1) Specific dates relating to the identity
theft such as when the loss or theft of per-
sonal information occurred or when the
fraud(s) using the personal information oc-
curred, and how the consumer discovered or
otherwise learned of the theft.

(2) Identification information or any other
information about the perpetrator, if known.

(3) Name(s) of information furnisher(s), ac-
count numbers, or other relevant account in-
formation related to the identity theft.

(4) Any other information known to the
consumer about the identity theft.

(c) Examples of when it would or would not
be reasonable to request additional informa-
tion or documentation referenced in para-
graph (a)(8) of this section are provided for
illustrative purposes only, as follows:

(1) A law enforcement report containing
detailed information about the identity theft
and the signature, badge number or other
identification information of the individual
law enforcement official taking the report
should be sufficient on its face to support a
victim’s request. In this case, without an
identifiable concern, such as an indication
that the report was fraudulent, it would not
be reasonable for an information furnisher or
consumer reporting agency to request addi-
tional information or documentation.

(2) A consumer might provide a law en-
forcement report similar to the report in
paragraph (c)(1) of this section but certain

574
Federal Trade Commission

important information such as the con-
sumer’s date of birth or Social Security
number may be missing because the con-
sumer chose not to provide it. The informa-
tion furnisher or consumer reporting agency
could accept this report, but it would be rea-
sonable to require that the consumer provide
the missing information.

(3) A consumer might provide a law en-
forcement report generated by an automated
system with a simple allegation that an
identity theft occurred to support a request
for a tradeline block or cessation of informa-
tion furnishing. In such a case, it would be
reasonable for an information furnisher or
consumer reporting agency to ask that the
consumer fill out and have notarized the
Commission’s ID Theft Affidavit or a similar
form and provide some form of identification
documentation.

(4) A consumer might provide a law en-
forcement report generated by an automated
system with a simple allegation that an
identity theft occurred to support a request
for an extended fraud alert. In this case, it
would not be reasonable for a consumer re-
porting agency to require additional docu-
mentation or information, such as a nota-
rized affidavit.

otherwise noted.

$610.1 Definitions and rule of con-
struction.

(a) The definitions and rule of con-
struction set forth in this section apply
throughout this part.

(b) Definitions. (1) Annual file disclo-
sure means a file disclosure that is pro-
vided to a consumer, upon consumer
request and without charge, once in
any 12-month period, in compliance
with section612(a) of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681j(a).

(2) Associated consumer reporting agen-
cy means a consumer reporting agency
that owns or maintains consumer files
housed within systems operated by one
or more nationwide consumer report-
ing agencies.

(3) Consumer means an individual.

(4) Consumer report has the meaning
provided in section603(d) of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
1681a(d).

(5) Consumer reporting agency has the
meaning provided in section603(f) of
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15
U.S.C. 1681acf).

(6) Extraordinary request volume, ex-
cept as provided in sections 610.2(i1) and
610.3(¢) of this part, occurs when the
number of consumers requesting or at-
tempting to request file disclosures
during any 24-hour period is more than
175% of the rolling 90-day daily average
of consumers requesting or attempting
to request file disclosures. For exam-
ple, if over the previous 90 days an av-
erage of 100 consumers per day re-
quested or attempted to request file
disclosures, then extraordinary request
volume would be any volume greater
than 175% of 100, i.e., 176 or more re-
quests in a single 24-hour period.

(7) File disclosure means a disclosure
by a consumer reporting agency pursu-
ant to section 609 of the Fair Credit Re-
porting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681¢.

(8) High request volume, except as pro-
vided in sections 610.2(¢i) and 610.3(2) of
this part, occurs when the number of
consumers requesting or attempting to
request file disclosures during any 24-
hour period is more than 125% of the

575
§ 610.2

rolling 90-day daily average of con-
sumers requesting or attempting to re-
quest file disclosures. For example, if
over the previous 90 days an average of
100 consumers per day requested or at-
tempted to request file disclosures,
then high request volume would be any
volume greater than 125% of 100, i.e.,
126 or more requests in a single 24-hour
period.

(9) Nationwide consumer reporting
agency means a consumer reporting
agency that compiles and maintains
files on consumers on a nationwide
basis as defined in section 603(p) of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
1681la(p).

(10) Nationwide specialty consumer re-
porting agency has the meaning pro-
vided in section 603(w) of the Fair Cred-
it Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 168la(w).

(11) Request method means the method
by which a consumer chooses to com-
municate a request for an annual file
disclosure.

(c) Rule of construction. The examples
in this part are illustrative and not ex-
clusive. Compliance with an example,
to the extent applicable, constitutes
compliance with this part.

§610.2 Centralized source for request-
ing annual file disclosures from na-
tionwide consumer reporting agen-
cies.

(a) Purpose. The purpose of the cen-
tralized source is to enable consumers
to make a single request to obtain an-
nual file disclosures from all nation-
wide consumer reporting agencies, as
required under section 612(a) of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
1681j(a).

(b) Establishment and operation. All
nationwide consumer reporting agen-
cies shall jointly design, fund, imple-
ment, maintain, and operate a central-
ized source for the purpose described in
paragraph (a) of this section. The cen-
tralized source required by this part
shall:

(1) Enable consumers to request an-
nual file disclosures by any of the fol-
lowing request methods, at the con-
sumers’ option:

(i) A single,
website,

(ii) A single, dedicated toll-free tele-
phone number; and

dedicated Internet

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(iii) Mail directed to a single address;

(2) Be designed, funded, implemented,
maintained, and operated in a manner
that:

(i) Has adequate capacity to accept
requests from the reasonably antici-
pated volume of consumers contacting
the centralized source through each re-
quest method, as determined in accord-
ance with paragraph (c) of this section;

(ii) Collects only as much personally
identifiable information as is reason-
ably necessary to properly identify the
consumer as required under the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, section 610(a)(1),
15 U.S.C. 1681h(a)(1), and other applica-
ble laws and regulations, and to proc-
ess the transaction(s) requested by the
consumer;

(iii) Provides information through
the centralized source website and tele-
phone number regarding how to make a
request by all request methods re-
quired under §610.2(b)(1) of this part;
and

(iv) Provides clear and easily under-
standable information and instructions
to consumers, including, but not nec-
essarily limited to:

(A) Providing information on the
progress of the consumer’s request
while the consumer is engaged in the
process of requesting a file disclosure;

(B) For a website request method,
providing access to a “help” or “fre-
quently asked questions” screen, which
includes specific information that con-
sumers might reasonably need to re-
quest file disclosures, the answers to
questions that consumers might rea-
sonably ask, and instructions whereby

(D) A statement indicating that the
consumer has reached the website or
telephone number for ordering free an-
nual credit reports as required by fed-
eral law; and

(3) Make available to consumers a
standardized form established jointly
by the nationwide consumer reporting
agencies, which consumers may use to
make a request for an annual file dis-
closure, either by mail or on the Inter-
net website required under §610.2(b)(1)
of this part, from the centralized
source required by this part. The form
provided at 16 CFR Part 698, Appendix
D, may be used to comply with this
section.

(c) Requirement to anticipate. The na-
tionwide consumer reporting agencies
shall implement reasonable procedures
to anticipate, and to respond to, the
volume of consumers who will contact
the centralized source through each re-
quest method, to request, or attempt
to request, a file disclosure, including
developing and implementing contin-
gency plans to address circumstances
that are reasonably likely to occur and
that may materially and adversely im-
pact the operation of the nationwide
consumer reporting agency, a central-
ized source request method, or the cen-
tralized source.

(1) The contingency plans required by
this section shall include reasonable
measures to minimize the impact of
such circumstances on the operation of
the centralized source and on con-
sumers contacting, or attempting to
contact, the centralized source.

(i) Such reasonable measures to min-
imize impact shall include, but are not
necessarily limited to:

(A) The extent reasonably prac-
ticable under the circumstances, pro-
viding information to consumers on
how to use another available request
method;

(B) The extent reasonably prac-
ticable under the circumstances, com-
municating, to a consumer who at-
tempts but is unable to make a re-
quest, the fact that a condition exists
that has precluded the centralized
source from accepting all requests, and
the period of time after which the cen-
tralized source is reasonably antici-
pated to be able to accept the con-

§ 610.2

sumers’ request for an annual file dis-
closure; and

(C) Taking all reasonable steps to re-
store the centralized source to normal
operating status as quickly as reason-
ably practicable under’ the cir-
cumstances.

(ii) Reasonable measures to minimize
impact may also include, as appro-
priate, collecting request information
but declining to accept the request for
processing until a reasonable later
time, provided that the consumer is
clearly and prominently informed, to
the extent reasonably practicable
under the circumstances, of when the
request will be accepted for processing.

(2) A nationwide consumer reporting
agency shall not be deemed in viola-
tion of §610.2(b)(2)Gi) of this part if a
centralized source request method is
unavailable to accept requests for a
reasonable period of time for purposes
of conducting maintenance on the re-
quest method, provided that the other
required request methods remain avail-
able during such time.

(d) Disclosures required. If a nation-
wide consumer reporting agency has
the ability to provide a consumer re-
port to a third party relating to a con-
sumer, regardless of whether the con-
sumer report is owned by that nation-
wide consumer reporting agency or by
an associated consumer reporting agen-
cy, that nationwide consumer report-
ing agency shall, upon proper identi-
fication in compliance with section
610(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681h(a)(1), provide an
annual file disclosure to such consumer
if the consumer makes a_ request
through the centralized source.

(e) High request volume and extraor-
dinary request volume—(1) High request
volume. Provided that a nationwide
consumer reporting agency has imple-
mented reasonable procedures devel-
oped in accordance with paragraph (c)
of this section, entitled “requirement
to anticipate,” the nationwide con-
sumer reporting agency shall not be
deemed in violation of paragraph
(b)(2)Ci) of this section for any period of
time in which a centralized source re-
quest method, the centralized source,
or the nationwide consumer reporting

577
§ 610.2

agency experiences high request vol-
ume, if the nationwide consumer re-
porting agency:

(i) Collects all consumer request in-
formation and delays accepting the re-
quest for processing until a reasonable
later time; and

(ii) Clearly and prominently informs
the consumer of when the request will
be accepted for processing.

(2) Extraordinary request volume. Pro-
vided that the nationwide consumer re-
porting agency has implemented rea-
sonable procedures developed in com-
pliance with paragraph (c) of this sec-
tion, entitled “requirement to antici-
pate,” the nationwide consumer report-
ing agency shall not be deemed in vio-
lation of paragraph (b)(2)G) of this sec-
tion for any period of time during
which a particular centralized source
request method, the centralized source,
or the nationwide consumer reporting
agency experiences extraordinary re-
quest volume.

(f) Information use and disclosure. Any
personally identifiable information col-
lected from consumers as a result of a
request for annual file disclosure, or
other disclosure required by the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, made through
the centralized source, may be used or
disclosed by the centralized source or a
nationwide consumer reporting agency
only:

(1) To provide the annual file disclo-
sure or other disclosure required under
the FCRA requested by the consumer;

(2) To process a transaction re-
quested by the consumer at the same
time as a request for annual file disclo-
sure or other disclosure;

(3) To comply with applicable legal
requirements, including those imposed
by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and
this part; and

(4) To update personally identifiable
information already maintained by the
nationwide consumer reporting agency
for the purpose of providing consumer
reports, provided that the nationwide
consumer reporting agency uses and
discloses the updated personally identi-
fiable information subject to the same
restrictions that would apply, under
any applicable provision of law or regu-
lation, to the information updated or
replaced.

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(g) Communications provided through
centralized source. (1) Any advertising
or marketing for products or services,
any communications or instructions
that advertise or market any products
or services, or any request to establish
an account through the centralized
source must be delayed until after the
consumer has obtained his or her an-
nual file disclosure.

(i) In the case of requests made by
mail or telephone, the consumer “has
obtained his or her annual file disclo-
sure” when the file disclosure is mailed,
and the nationwide consumer reporting
agency may include advertising for
other products or services with the file
disclosure.

(ii) In the case of requests made
through the centralized source Internet
website, the consumer “has obtained
his or her annual file disclosure” when
the file disclosure is delivered to the
consumer through the Internet, and
the nationwide consumer reporting
agency may include advertising for
other products or services with the file
disclosure.

(2) Any communications, instruc-
tions, or permitted advertising or mar-
keting shall not interfere with, detract
from, contradict, or otherwise under-
mine the purpose of the centralized
source stated in paragraph (a) of this
section.

(3) Examples of interfering, detract-
ing, inconsistent, and/or undermining
communications include:

(i) Centralized source materials that
represent, expressly or by implication,
that a consumer must purchase a paid
product or service in order to receive
or to understand the annual file disclo-
sure;

(ii) Centralized source materials that
represent, expressly or by implication,
that annual file disclosures are not
free, or that obtaining an annual file
disclosure will have a negative impact
on the consumers’ credit standing; and

(iii) Centralized source materials
that falsely represent, expressly or by
implication, that a product or service
offered ancillary to receipt of a file dis-
closure, such as a credit score or credit
monitoring service, is free, or fail to
clearly and prominently disclose that
consumers must cancel a service, ad-
vertised as free for an initial period of

578
Federal Trade Commission

time, to avoid being charged, if such is
the case.

(h) Other practices prohibited through
the centralized source. The centralized
source shall not:

(1) Contain hyperlinks to commercial
or proprietary websites until after the
consumer has obtained his or her an-
nual file disclosure, except for tech-
nical transfers to a web page on which
consumers can request their free an-
nual file disclosure; provided, however,
that no hyperlinks to commercial
websites shall appear on the initial
page of the centralized source.

(2) Require consumers to set up an
account in connection with obtaining
an annual file disclosure; or

(3) Ask or require consumers to agree
to terms or conditions in connection
with obtaining an annual file disclo-
sure.

$611.1 Rule of construction.

The examples in this part are illus-
trative and not exclusive. Compliance
with an example, to the extent applica-
ble, constitutes compliance with this
part.

§611.2 General prohibition.

(a) A consumer reporting agency
shall not circumvent or evade treat-
ment as a “consumer reporting agency
that compiles and maintains files on
consumers on a nationwide basis’ as de-
fined under section 608(p) of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
168la(p), by any means, including, but
not limited to:

(1) Corporate organization, reorga-
nization, structure, or restructuring,
including merger, acquisition, dissolu-
tion, divestiture, or asset sale of a con-
sumer reporting agency; or

(2) Maintaining or merging public
record and credit account information
in a manner that is substantially
equivalent to that described in para-
graphs (1) and (2) of section 608(p) of
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15
U.S.C. 1681a(p).

(b) Examples:

(1) Circumvention through reorganiza-
tion by data type. XYZ Inc. is a con-
sumer reporting agency that compiles
and maintains files on consumers on a
nationwide basis. It restructures its op-
erations so that public record informa-
tion is assembled and maintained only
by its corporate affiliate, ABC Inc.
XYZ continues operating as a con-
sumer reporting agency but ceases to
comply with the FCRA obligations of a
consumer reporting agency that com-
piles and maintains files on consumers
on a nationwide basis, asserting that it

583
§ 611.3

no longer meets the definition found in
FCRA section 603 (p), because it no
longer maintains public record infor-
mation. XYZ’s conduct is a circumven-
tion or evasion of treatment as a con-
sumer reporting agency that compiles
and maintains files on consumers on a
nationwide basis, and thus violates this
section.

(2) Circumvention through reorganiza-
tion by regional operations. PDQ Inc. is a
consumer reporting agency that com-
piles and maintains files on consumers
on a nationwide basis. It restructures
its operations so that corporate affili-
ates separately assemble and maintain
all information on consumers residing
in each state. PDQ continues to oper-
ate as a consumer reporting agency but
ceases to comply with the FCRA obli-
gations of a consumer reporting agency
that compiles and maintains files on
consumers on a nationwide basis, as-
serting that it no longer meets the def-
inition found in FCRA section 6038(p),
because it no longer operates on a na-
tionwide basis. PDQ’s conduct is a cir-
cumvention or evasion of treatment as
a consumer reporting agency that com-
piles and maintains files on consumers
on a nationwide basis, and thus vio-
lates this section.

(3) Circumvention by a newly formed
entity. Smith Co. is a new entrant in
the marketplace for consumer reports
that bear on a consumer’s credit wor-
thiness, standing and capacity. Smith
Co. organizes itself into two affiliated
companies: Smith Credit Co. and Smith
Public Records Co. Smith Credit Co.
assembles and maintains credit ac-
count information from persons who
furnish that information regularly and
in the ordinary course of business on
consumers residing nationwide. Smith
Public Records Co. assembles and
maintains public record information on
consumers nationwide. Neither Smith
Co. nor its affiliated organizations
comply with FCRA obligations of con-
sumer reporting agencies that compile
and maintain files on consumers on a
nationwide basis. Smith Co.”s conduct
is a circumvention or evasion of treat-
ment as a consumer reporting agency
that compiles and maintains files on
consumers on a nationwide basis, and
thus violates this section.

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(4) Bona fide, arms-length trans-
action with unaffiliated party. Foster
Ltd. is a consumer reporting agency
that compiles and maintains files on
consumers on a nationwide basis. Fos-
ter Ltd. sells its public record informa-
tion business to an unaffiliated com-
pany in a bona fide, arms-length trans-
action. Foster Ltd. ceases to assemble,
evaluate and maintain public record
information on consumers residing na-
tionwide, and ceases to offer reports
containing public record information.
Foster Ltd.”s conduct is not a cir-
cumvention or evasion of treatment as
a consumer reporting agency that com-
piles and maintains files on consumers
on a nationwide basis. Foster Ltd.”s
conduct does not violate this part.

§611.3 Limitation on applicability.

Any person who is otherwise in viola-
tion of §611.2 shall be deemed to be in
compliance with this part if such per-
son is in compliance with all obliga-
tions imposed upon consumer reporting
agencies that compile and maintain
files on consumers on a nationwide
basis under the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.

PART 614—APPROPRIATE PROOF
OF IDENTITY

Sec.
614.1 Appropriate proof of identity.

AUTHORITY: Pub. L. 108-159, sec. 112(b).

§614.1 Appropriate proof of identity.

(a) Consumer reporting agencies shall
develop and implement reasonable re-
quirements for what information con-
sumers shall provide to constitute

584
Federal Trade Commission

proof of identity for purposes of sec-
tions 605A, 605B, and 609(a)(1) of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act. In devel-
oping these requirements, the con-
sumer reporting agencies must:

(1) Ensure that the information is
sufficient to enable the consumer re-
porting agency to match consumers
with their files; and

(2) Adjust the information to be com-
mensurate with an identifiable risk of
harm arising from misidentifying the
consumer.

(b) Examples of information that
might constitute reasonable informa-
tion requirements for proof of identity
are provided for illustrative purposes
only, as follows:

(1) Consumer file match: The identi-
fication information of the consumer
including his or her full name (first,
middle initial, last, suffix), any other
or previously used names, current and/
or recent full address (street number
and name, apt. no., city, state, and zip
code), full 9 digits of Social Security
number, and/or date of birth.

(2) Additional proof of identity: cop-
ies of government issued identification
documents, utility bills, and/or other
methods of authentication of a person’s
identity which may include, but would
not be limited to, answering questions
to which only the consumer might be
expected to know the answer.

§640.1 Scope.

(a) Coverage—(1) In general. This part
applies to any person that both—

(i) Uses a consumer report in connec-
tion with an application for, or a grant,

§ 640.2

extension, or other provision of, credit
to a consumer that is primarily for per-
sonal, family, or household purposes;
and

(ii) Based in whole or in part on the
consumer report, grants, extends, or
otherwise provides credit to the con-
sumer on material terms that are ma-
terially less favorable than the most
favorable material terms available to a
substantial proportion of consumers
from or through that person.

(2) Business credit excluded. This part
does not apply to an application for, or
a grant, extension, or other provision
of, credit to a consumer or to any other
applicant primarily for a business pur-
pose.

(b) Relation to Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System rules. The
rules in this part were developed joint-
ly with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Board) and
are substantively identical to the
Board’s risk-based pricing rules in 12
CFR part 222. Both rules apply to the
covered person described in paragraph
(a) of this section. Compliance with ei-
ther the Board’s rules or the Commis-
sion’s rules satisfies the requirements
of the statute (15 U.S.C. 1681m(h)).

(c) Enforcement. The provisions of
this part will be enforced in accordance
with the enforcement authority set
forth in sections 621(a) and (b) of the
FCRA.

$640.2 Definitions.

For purposes of this part, the fol-
lowing definitions apply:

(a) Adverse action has the same mean-
ing as in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(k)(1)(A).

(b) Annual percentage rate has the
same meaning as in 12 CFR 226.14(b)
with respect to an open-end credit plan

same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 1681lacf).

(h) Credit has the same meaning as in
15 U.S.C. 1681a(r)(5).

585
§ 640.3

(i) Creditor has the same meaning as
in 15 U.S.C. 1681la(r)(5).

(j) Credit card has the same meaning
as in 15 U.S.C. 1681la(r)(2).

(k) Credit card issuer has the same
meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 168la(r)(1)(A).

(1) Credit score has the same meaning
asin 15 U.S.C. 1681g(f)(2)(A).

(m) Firm offer of credit has the same

(n) Material terms means—

(1) i) Except as otherwise provided in
paragraphs (n)(1)(ii) and ()(8) of this
section, in the case of credit extended
under an open-end credit plan, the an-
nual percentage rate required to be dis-
closed under 12 CFR 226.6(a)(1)@ii) or 12
CFR 226.6(b)(2)G), excluding any tem-
porary initial rate that is lower than
the rate that will apply after the tem-
porary rate expires, any penalty rate
that will apply upon the occurrence of
one or more specific events, such as a
late payment or an extension of credit
that exceeds the credit limit, and any
fixed annual percentage rate option for
a home equity line of credit;

(ii) In the case of a credit card (other
than a credit card that is used to ac-
cess a home equity line of credit or a
charge card), the annual percentage
rate required to be disclosed under 12
CFR 226.6(0)(2)(i) that applies to pur-
chases (“purchase annual percentage
rate”) and no other annual percentage
rate, or in the case of a credit card that
has no purchase annual percentage
rate, the annual percentage rate that
varies based on information in a con-
sumer report and that has the most
significant financial impact on con-
sumers;

(2) In the case of closed-end credit,
the annual percentage rate required to
be disclosed under 12 CFR 226.17(c) and
226.18(e); and

(3) In the case of credit for which
there is no annual percentage rate, the
financial term that varies based on in-
formation in a consumer report and
that has the most significant financial
impact on consumers, such as a deposit
required in connection with credit ex-
tended by a telephone company or util-
ity or an annual membership fee for a
charge card.

(0) Materially less favorable means,
when applied to material terms, that
the terms granted, extended, or other-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

wise provided to a consumer differ
from the terms granted, extended, or
otherwise provided to another con-
sumer from or through the same person
such that the cost of credit to the first
consumer would be significantly great-
er than the cost of credit granted, ex-
tended, or otherwise provided to the
other consumer. For purposes of this
definition, factors relevant to deter-
mining the significance of a difference
in cost include the type of credit prod-
uct, the term of the credit extension, if
any, and the extent of the difference
between the material terms granted,
extended, or otherwise provided to the
two consumers.

(p) Open-end credit plan has the same
meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 1602(i), as inter-
preted by the Board in Regulation Z
and the Official Staff Commentary to
Regulation Z.

(q) Person has the same meaning as in
15 U.S.C. 1681a(b).

§ 640.3 General requirements for risk-
based pricing notices.

(a) In general. Except as otherwise
provided in this part, a person must
provide to a consumer a notice (“risk-
based pricing notice”) in the form and
manner required by this part if the per-
son both—

(1) Uses a consumer report in connec-
tion with an application for, or a grant,
extension, or other provision of, credit
to that consumer that is primarily for
personal, family, or household pur-
poses; and

(2) Based in whole or in part on the
consumer report, grants, extends, or
otherwise provides credit to that con-
sumer on material terms that are ma-
terially less favorable than the most
favorable material terms available to a
substantial proportion of consumers
from or through that person.

(b) Determining which consumers must
receive a notice. A person may deter-
mine whether paragraph (a) of this sec-
tion applies by directly comparing the
material terms offered to each con-
sumer and the material terms offered
to other consumers for a specific type
of credit product. For purposes of this
section, a “specific type of credit prod-
uct” means one or more credit products
with similar features that are designed
for similar purposes. Examples of a

586
Federal Trade Commission

specific type of credit product include
student loans, unsecured credit cards,
secured credit cards, new automobile
loans, used automobile loans, fixed-
rate mortgage loans, and variable-rate
mortgage loans. As an alternative to
making this direct comparison, a per-
son may make the determination by
using one of the following methods:

(1) Credit score proxy method—(i) In
general. A person that sets the material
terms of credit granted, extended, or
otherwise provided to a consumer,
based in whole or in part on a credit
score, may comply with the require-
ments of paragraph (a) of this section
by—

(A) Determining the credit score
(hereafter referred to as the “cutoff
score”) that represents the point at
which approximately 40 percent of the
consumers to whom it grants, extends,
or provides credit have higher credit
scores and approximately 60 percent of
the consumers to whom it grants, ex-
tends, or provides credit have lower
credit scores; and

(B) Providing a risk-based pricing no-
tice to each consumer to whom it
grants, extends, or provides credit
whose credit score is lower than the
cutoff score.

(ii) Alternative to the 40/60 cutoff score
determination. In the case of credit that
has been granted, extended, or provided
on the most favorable material terms
to more than 40 percent of consumers,
a person may, at its option, set its cut-
off score at a point at which the ap-
proximate percentage of consumers
who historically have been granted, ex-
tended, or provided credit on material
terms other than the most favorable
terms would receive risk-based pricing
notices under this section.

(iii) Determining the cutoff score—(A)
Sampling approach. A person that cur-
rently uses risk-based pricing with re-
spect to the credit products it offers
must calculate the cutoff score by con-
sidering the credit scores of all or a
representative sample of the con-
sumers to whom it has granted, ex-
tended, or provided credit for a specific
type of credit product.

(B) Secondary source approach in lim-
ited circumstances. A person that is a
new entrant into the credit business,
introduces new credit products, or

§ 640.3

starts to use risk-based pricing with re-
spect to the credit products it cur-
rently offers may initially determine
the cutoff score based on information
derived from appropriate market re-
search or relevant third-party sources
for a specific type of credit product,
such as research or data from compa-
nies that develop credit scores. A per-
son that acquires a credit portfolio as a
result of a merger or acquisition may
determine the cutoff score based on in-
formation from the party which it ac-
quired, with which it merged, or from
which it acquired the portfolio.

(C) Recalculation of cutoff scores. A
person using the credit score proxy
method must recalculate its cutoff
score(s) no less than every two years in
the manner described in paragraph
(b+)A)GiiD(A) of this section. A person
using the credit score proxy method
using market research, third-party
data, or information from a _ party
which it acquired, with which it
merged, or from which it acquired the
portfolio as permitted by paragraph
(_+)()GiDCB) of this section generally
must calculate a cutoff score(s) based
on the scores of its own consumers in
the manner described in paragraph
(bd) )Giii)(A) of this section within one
year after it begins using a cutoff score
derived from market research, third-
party data, or information from a
party which it acquired, with which it
merged, or from which it acquired the
portfolio. If such a person does not
grant, extend, or provide credit to new
consumers during that one-year period
such that it lacks sufficient data with
which to recalculate a cutoff score
based on the credit scores of its own
consumers, the person may continue to
use a cutoff score derived from market
research, third-party data, or informa-
tion from a party which it acquired,
with which it merged, or from which it
acquired the portfolio as provided in
paragraph (b)(1)dGii)(B) until it obtains
sufficient data on which to base the re-
calculation. However, the person must
recalculate its cutoff score(s) in the
manner described in paragraph
(bd) )Giii)(A) of this section within two
years, if it has granted, extended, or
provided credit to some new consumers
during that two-year period.

587
§ 640.3

(D) Use of two or more credit scores. A
person that generally uses two or more
credit scores in setting the material
terms of credit granted, extended, or
provided to a consumer must deter-
mine the cutoff score using the same
method the person uses to evaluate
multiple scores when making credit de-
cisions. These evaluation methods may
include, but are not limited to, select-
ing the low, median, high, most recent,
or average credit score of each con-
sumer to whom it grants, extends, or
provides credit. If a person that uses
two or more credit scores does not con-
sistently use the same method for eval-
uating multiple credit scores (e.g., if
the person sometimes chooses the me-
dian score and other times calculates
the average score), the person must de-
termine the cutoff score using a rea-
sonable means. In such cases, use of
any one of the methods that the person
regularly uses or the average credit
score of each consumer to whom it
grants, extends, or provides credit is
deemed to be a reasonable means of
calculating the cutoff score.

(iv) Credit score not available. For pur-
poses of this section, a person using the
credit score proxy method who grants,
extends, or provides credit to a con-
sumer for whom a credit score is not
available must assume that the con-
sumer receives credit on material
terms that are materially less favor-
able than the most favorable credit
terms offered to a substantial propor-
tion of consumers from or through that
person and must provide a risk-based
pricing notice to the consumer.

(v) Examples. (A) A credit card issuer
engages in risk-based pricing and the
annual percentage rates it offers to
consumers are based in whole or in
part on a credit score. The credit card
issuer takes a representative sample of
the credit scores of consumers to whom
it issued credit cards within the pre-
ceding three months. The credit card
issuer determines that approximately
40 percent of the sampled consumers
have a credit score at or above 720 (on
a scale of 350 to 850) and approximately
60 percent of the sampled consumers
have a credit score below 720. Thus, the
card issuer selects 720 as its cutoff
score. A consumer applies to the credit
card issuer for a credit card. The card

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

issuer obtains a credit score for the
consumer. The consumer’s credit score
is 700. Since the consumer’s 700 credit
score falls below the 720 cutoff score,
the credit card issuer must provide a
risk-based pricing notice to the con-
sumer.

(B) A credit card issuer engages in
risk-based pricing, and the annual per-
centage rates it offers to consumers are
based in whole or in part on a credit
score. The credit card issuer takes a
representative sample of the con-
sumers to whom it issued credit cards
over the preceding six months. The
credit card issuer determines that ap-
proximately 80 percent of the sampled
consumers received credit at its lowest
annual percentage rate, and 20 percent
received credit at a higher annual per-
centage rate. Approximately 80 percent
of the sampled consumers have a credit
score at or above 750 (on a scale of 350
to 850), and 20 percent have a credit
score below 750. Thus, the card issuer
selects 750 as its cutoff score. A con-
sumer applies to the credit card issuer
for a credit card. The card issuer ob-
tains a credit score for the consumer.
The consumer’s credit score is 740.
Since the consumer’s 740 credit score
falls below the 750 cutoff score, the
credit card issuer must provide a risk-
based pricing notice to the consumer.

(C) An auto lender engages in risk-
based pricing, obtains credit scores
from one of the nationwide consumer
reporting agencies, and uses the credit
score proxy method to determine which
consumers must receive a risk-based
pricing notice. A consumer applies to
the auto lender for credit to finance
the purchase of an automobile. A credit
score about that consumer is not avail-
able from the consumer reporting agen-
cy from which the lender obtains credit
scores. The lender nevertheless grants,
extends, or provides credit to the con-
sumer. The lender must provide a risk-
based pricing notice to the consumer.

(2) Tiered pricing method—(i) In gen-
eral. A person that sets the material
terms of credit granted, extended, or
provided to a consumer by placing the
consumer within one of a discrete num-
ber of pricing tiers for a specific type
of credit product, based in whole or in
part on a consumer report, may comply
with the requirements of paragraph (a)

588
Federal Trade Commission

of this section by providing a risk-
based pricing notice to each consumer
who is not placed within the top pric-
ing tier or tiers, as described below.

(ii) Four or fewer pricing tiers. If a per-
son using the tiered pricing method has
four or fewer pricing tiers, the person
complies with the requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section by pro-
viding a risk-based pricing notice to
each consumer to whom it grants, ex-
tends, or provides credit who does not
qualify for the top tier (that is, the
lowest-priced tier). For example, a per-
son that uses a tiered pricing structure
with annual percentage rates of 8, 10,
12, and 14 percent would provide the
risk-based pricing notice to each con-
sumer to whom it grants, extends, or
provides credit at annual percentage
rates of 10, 12, and 14 percent.

(iii) Five or more pricing tiers. If a per-
son using the tiered pricing method has
five or more pricing tiers, the person
complies with the requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section by pro-
viding a risk-based pricing notice to
each consumer to whom it grants, ex-
tends, or provides credit who does not
qualify for the top two tiers (that is,
the two lowest-priced tiers) and any
other tier that, together with the top
tiers, comprise no less than the top 30
percent but no more than the top 40
percent of the total number of tiers.
Each consumer placed within the re-
maining tiers must receive a risk-based
pricing notice. For example, if a person
has nine pricing tiers, the top three
tiers (that is, the three lowest-priced
tiers) comprise no less than the top 30
percent but no more than the top 40
percent of the tiers. Therefore, a per-
son using this method would provide a
risk-based pricing notice to each con-
sumer to whom it grants, extends, or
provides credit who is placed within
the bottom six tiers.

(c) Application to credit card issuers—
(1) In general. A credit card issuer sub-
ject to the requirements of paragraph
(a) of this section may use one of the
methods set forth in paragraph (b) of
this section to identify consumers to
whom it must provide a risk-based
pricing notice. Alternatively, a credit
card issuer may satisfy its obligations
under paragraph (a) of this section by

§ 640.3

providing a risk-based pricing notice to
a consumer when—

(i) A consumer applies for a credit
card either in connection with an ap-
plication program, such as a direct-
mail offer or a take-one application, or
in response to a solicitation under 12
CFR 226.5a, and more than a single pos-
sible purchase annual percentage rate
may apply under the program or solici-
tation; and

(ii) Based in whole or in part on a
consumer report, the credit card issuer
provides a credit card to the consumer
with an annual percentage rate ref-
erenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gi) that is great-
er than the lowest annual percentage
rate referenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gi) avail-
able in connection with the application
or solicitation.

(2) No requirement to compare different
offers. A credit card issuer is not sub-
ject to the requirements of paragraph
(a) of this section and is not required
to provide a risk-based pricing notice
to a consumer if—

(i) The consumer applies for a credit
card for which the card issuer provides
a single annual percentage rate ref-
erenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gi), excluding a
temporary initial rate that is lower
than the rate that will apply after the
temporary rate expires and a penalty
rate that will apply upon the occur-
rence of one or more specific events,
such as a late payment or an extension
of credit that exceeds the credit limit;
or

(ii) The credit card issuer offers the
consumer the lowest annual percentage
rate referenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gi) avail-
able under the credit card offer for
which the consumer applied, even if a
lower annual percentage rate ref-
erenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gi) is available
under a different credit card offer
issued by the card issuer.

(3) Examples. (i) A credit card issuer
sends a solicitation to the consumer
that discloses several possible purchase
annual percentage rates that may
apply, such as 10, 12, or 14 percent, ora
range of purchase annual percentage
rates from 10 to 14 percent. The con-
sumer applies for a credit card in re-
sponse to the solicitation. The card
issuer provides a credit card to the con-
sumer with a purchase annual percent-
age rate of 12 percent based in whole or

589
§ 640.4

in part on a consumer report. Unless an
exception applies under § 640.5, the card
issuer may satisfy its obligations under
paragraph (a) of this section by pro-
viding a risk-based pricing notice to
the consumer because the consumer re-
ceived credit at a purchase annual per-
centage rate greater than the lowest
purchase annual percentage rate avail-
able under that solicitation.

(ii) The same facts as in the example
in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section,
except that the card issuer provides a
credit card to the consumer at a pur-
chase annual percentage rate of 10 per-
cent. The card issuer is not required to
provide a risk-based pricing notice to
the consumer even if, under a different
credit card solicitation, that consumer
or other consumers might qualify for a
purchase annual percentage rate of 8
percent.

(d) Account review—(1) In general. Exx-
cept as otherwise provided in this part,
a person is subject to the requirements
of paragraph (a) of this section and
must provide a risk-based pricing no-
tice to a consumer in the form and
manner required by this part if the per-
son—

(i) Uses a consumer report in connec-
tion with a review of credit that has
been extended to the consumer; and

(ii) Based in whole or in part on the
consumer report, increases the annual
percentage rate (the annual percentage
rate referenced in §640.2(n)(1)Gii) in the
case of a credit card).

(2) Example. A credit card issuer peri-
odically obtains consumer reports for
the purpose of reviewing the terms of
credit it has extended to consumers in
connection with credit cards. As a re-
sult of this review, the credit card
issuer increases the purchase annual
percentage rate applicable to a con-
sumer’s credit card based in whole or
in part on information in a consumer
report. The credit card issuer is subject
to the requirements of paragraph (a) of
this section and must provide a risk-
based pricing notice to the consumer.

$640.4 Content, form, and timing of
risk-based pricing notices.

(a) Content of the notice—(1) In gen-
eral. The risk-based pricing notice re-

written, or electronic form.

(2) Model forms. A model form of the
risk-based pricing notice required by
§640.3(a) and (c) is contained in 16 CFR
Part 698, Appendix B. Appropriate use
of Model Form B-1 is deemed to com-
ply with the content and form require-
ments of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of
this section. A model form of the risk-
based pricing notice required by
§640.3(d) is also contained in Appendix
B of that part. Appropriate use of
Model Form B-2 is deemed to comply
with the content and form require-
ments of paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of
this section. Use of the model forms is
optional.

(c) Timing—(1) General. Except as pro-
vided in paragraph (c)(3) of this sec-
tion, a risk-based pricing notice must
be provided to the consumer—

(i) In the case of a grant, extension,
or other provision of closed-end credit,
before consummation of the _ trans-
action, but not earlier than the time

§ 640.4

the decision to approve an application
for, or a grant, extension, or other pro-
vision of, credit, is communicated to
the consumer by the person required to
provide the notice;

(ii) In the case of credit granted, ex-
tended, or provided under an open-end
credit plan, before the first transaction
is made under the plan, but not earlier
than the time the decision to approve
an application for, or a grant, exten-
sion, or other provision of, credit is

or if no notice of the increase in the
annual percentage rate is provided to
the consumer prior to the effective
date of the change in the annual per-
centage rate (to the extent permitted
by law), no later than five days after
the effective date of the change in the
annual percentage rate.

(2) Application to certain automobile
lending transactions. When a person to
whom a credit obligation is initially
payable grants, extends, or provides
credit to a consumer for the purpose of
financing the purchase of an auto-
mobile from an auto dealer or other
party that is not affiliated with the
person, any requirement to provide a
risk-based pricing notice pursuant to
this part is satisfied if the person:

(i) Provides a notice described in
§§ 640.3(a), 640.5(e), or 640.5(f) to the con-
sumer within the time periods set forth
in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,
§ 640.5(e)(3), or § 640.5(f£)(4), as applicable;
or

(ii) Arranges to have the auto dealer
or other party provide a notice de-
scribed in §§640.3(a), 640.5(e), or 640.5(f)
to the consumer on its behalf within
the time periods set forth in paragraph
(c)Q)q) of this section, §640.5(e)(3), or
§640.5(f)(4), as applicable, and main-
tains reasonable policies and proce-
dures to verify that the auto dealer or
other party provides such notice to the

591
§ 640.5

consumer within the applicable time
periods. If the person arranges to have
the auto dealer or other party provide
a notice described in §640.5(e), the per-
son’s obligation is satisfied if the con-
sumer receives a notice containing a
credit score obtained by the dealer or
other party, even if a different credit
score is obtained and used by the per-
son on whose behalf the notice is pro-
vided.

(3) Timing requirements for contempora-
neous purchase credit. When credit
under an open-end credit plan is grant-
ed, extended, or provided to a consumer
in person or by telephone for the pur-
pose of financing the contemporaneous
purchase of goods or services, any risk-
based pricing notice required to be pro-
vided pursuant to this part (or the dis-
closures permitted under §640.5(e) or
(f)) may be provided at the earlier of:

(i) The time of the first mailing by
the person to the consumer after the
decision is made to approve the grant,
extension, or other provision of open-
end credit, such as in a mailing con-
taining the account agreement or a
credit card; or

(ii) Within 30 days after the decision
to approve the grant, extension, or
other provision of credit.

§640.5 Exceptions.

(a) Application for specific terms—(1) In
general. A person is not required to pro-
vide a risk-based pricing notice to the
consumer under §640.3(a) or (c) if the
consumer applies for specific material
terms and is granted those terms, un-
less those terms were specified by the
person using a consumer report after
the consumer applied for or requested
credit and after the person obtained
the consumer report. For purposes of
this section, “specific material terms”
means a single material term, or set of
material terms, such as an annual per-
centage rate of 10 percent, and not a
range of alternatives, such as an an-
nual percentage rate that may be 8, 10,
or 12 percent, or between 8 and 12 per-
cent.

(2) Example. A consumer receives a
firm offer of credit from a credit card
issuer. The terms of the firm offer are
based in whole or in part on informa-
tion from a consumer report that the
credit card issuer obtained under the

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

FCRA’s firm offer of credit provisions.
The solicitation offers the consumer a
credit card with a single purchase an-
nual percentage rate of 12 percent. The
consumer applies for and receives a
credit card with an annual percentage
rate of 12 percent. Other customers
with the same credit card have a pur-
chase annual percentage rate of 10 per-
cent. The exception applies because the
consumer applied for specific material
terms and was granted those terms. Al-
though the credit card issuer specified
the annual percentage rate in the firm
offer of credit based in whole or in part
on a consumer report, the credit card
issuer specified that material term be-
fore, not after, the consumer applied for
or requested credit.

(b) Adverse action notice. A person is
not required to provide a risk-based
pricing notice to the consumer under
§640.3(a), (c), or (d) if the person pro-
vides an adverse action notice to the
consumer under section 615(a) of the
FCRA.

(c) Prescreened solicitations—(1) In gen-
eral. A person is not required to provide
a risk-based pricing notice to the con-
sumer under §640.3(a) or (c) if the per-
son:

(i) Obtains a consumer report that is
a prescreened list as described in sec-
tion 604(c)(2) of the FCRA; and

(ii) Uses the consumer report for the
purpose of making a firm offer of credit
to the consumer.

(2) More favorable material terms. This
exception applies to any firm offer of
credit offered by a person to a con-
sumer, even if the person makes other
firm offers of credit to other consumers
on more favorable material terms.

(3) Example. A credit card issuer ob-
tains two prescreened lists from a con-
sumer reporting agency. One list in-
cludes consumers with high credit
scores. The other list includes con-
sumers with low credit scores. The
issuer mails a firm offer of credit to
the high credit score consumers with a
single purchase annual percentage rate
of 10 percent. The issuer also mails a
firm offer of credit to the low credit
score consumers with a single purchase
annual percentage rate of 14 percent.
The credit card issuer is not required
to provide a risk-based pricing notice
to the low credit score consumers who

592
Federal Trade Commission

receive the 14 percent offer because use
of a consumer report to make a firm
offer of credit does not trigger the risk-
based pricing notice requirement.

(d) Loans secured by residential real
property—credit score disclosure—(1) In
general. A person is not required to pro-
vide a risk-based pricing notice to a
consumer under §640.8(a) or (c) if:

(i) The consumer requests from the
person an extension of credit that is or
will be secured by one to four units of
residential real property; and

(ii) The person provides to each con-
sumer described in paragraph (d)(1)()
of this section a notice that contains
the following—

(A) A statement that a consumer re-
port (or credit report) is a record of the
consumer’s credit history and includes
information about whether the con-
sumer pays his or her obligations on
time and how much the consumer owes
to creditors;

(B) A statement that a credit score is
a number that takes into account in-
formation in a consumer report and
that a credit score can change over
time to reflect changes in the con-
sumer’s credit history;

(C) A statement that the consumer’s
credit score can affect whether the con-
sumer can obtain credit and what the
cost of that credit will be;

(D) The information required to be
disclosed to the consumer pursuant to
section 609(¢) of the FCRA;

(E) The distribution of credit scores
among consumers who are scored under
the same scoring model that is used to
generate the consumer’s credit score
using the same scale as that of the
credit score that is provided to the con-
sumer, presented in the form of a bar
graph containing a minimum of six
bars that illustrates the percentage of
consumers with credit scores within
the range of scores reflected in each
bar or by other clear and readily under-
standable graphical means, or a clear
and readily understandable statement
informing the consumer how his or her
credit score compares to the scores of
other consumers. Use of a graph or
statement obtained from the person
providing the credit score that meets
the requirements of this paragraph
(d)(1)\Gii)(E) is deemed to comply with
this requirement;

§ 640.5

(F) A statement that the consumer is
encouraged to verify the accuracy of
the information contained in the con-
sumer report and has the right to dis-
pute any inaccurate information in the
report;

(G) A statement that federal law
gives the consumer the right to obtain
copies of his or her consumer reports
directly from the consumer reporting
agencies, including a free report from
each of the nationwide consumer re-
porting agencies once during any 12-
month period;

(H) Contact information for the cen-
tralized source from which consumers
may obtain their free annual consumer
reports; and

(I) A statement directing consumers
to the web sites of the Board and Fed-
eral Trade Commission to obtain more
information about consumer reports.

(2) Form of the notice. The notice de-
scribed in paragraph (d)(1)di) of this
section must be:

(i) Clear and conspicuous;

(ii) Provided on or with the notice re-
quired by section 609(g) of the FCRA;

(iii) Segregated from other informa-
tion provided to the consumer, except
for the notice required by section 609(¢)
of the FCRA; and

(iv) Provided to the consumer in
writing and in a form that the con-
sumer may Keep.

(3) Timing. The notice described in
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section must
be provided to the consumer at the
time the disclosure required by section
609(¢) of the FCRA is provided to the
consumer, but in any event at or before
consummation in the case of closed-
end credit or before the first trans-
action is made under an open-end cred-
it plan.

(4) Multiple credit scores—G) In gen-
eral. When a person obtains two or
more credit scores from consumer re-
porting agencies and uses one of those
credit scores in setting the material
terms of credit granted, extended, or
otherwise provided to a consumer, for
example, by using the low, middle,
high, or most recent score, the notice
described in paragraph (d)(1)di) of this
section must include that credit score
and the other information required by
that paragraph. When a person obtains

593
§ 640.5

two or more credit scores from con-
sumer reporting agencies and uses mul-
tiple credit scores in setting the mate-
rial terms of credit granted, extended,
or otherwise provided to a consumer,
for example, by computing the average
of all the credit scores obtained, the
notice described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)
of this section must include one of
those credit scores and the other infor-
mation required by that paragraph.
The notice may, at the person’s option,
include more than one credit score,
along with the additional information
specified in paragraph (d)(1)dii) of this
section for each credit score disclosed.

(ii) Examples. (A) A person that uses
consumer reports to set the material
terms of mortgage credit granted, ex-
tended, or provided to consumers regu-
larly requests credit scores from sev-
eral consumer reporting agencies and
uses the low score when determining
the material terms it will offer to the
consumer. That person must disclose
the low score in the notice described in
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.

(B) A person that uses consumer re-
ports to set the material terms of
mortgage credit granted, extended, or
provided to consumers regularly re-
quests credit scores from several con-
sumer reporting agencies, each of
which it uses in an underwriting pro-
gram in order to determine the mate-
rial terms it will offer to the consumer.
That person may choose one of these
scores to include in the notice de-
scribed in paragraph (d)(1)di) of this
section.

(5) Model form. A model form of the
notice described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)
of this section consolidated with the
notice required by section 609(¢) of the
FCRA is contained in 16 CFR Part 698,
Appendix B. Appropriate use of Model
Form B-3 is deemed to comply with the
requirements of §640.5(d). Use of the
model form is optional.

(e) Other extensions of credit—credit
score disclosure—(1) In general. A person
is not required to provide a risk-based
pricing notice to a consumer under
§ 640.3(a) or (c) if:

(i) The consumer requests from the
person an extension of credit other
than credit that is or will be secured by
one to four units of residential real
property; and

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(ii) The person provides to each con-
sumer described in paragraph (e)(1)(i)
of this section a notice that contains
the following—

(A) A statement that a consumer re-
port (or credit report) is a record of the
consumer’s credit history and includes
information about whether the con-
sumer pays his or her obligations on
time and how much the consumer owes
to creditors;

(B) A statement that a credit score is
a number that takes into account in-
formation in a consumer report and
that a credit score can change over
time to reflect changes in the con-
sumer’s credit history;

(C) A statement that the consumer’s
credit score can affect whether the con-
sumer can obtain credit and what the
cost of that credit will be;

(D) The current credit score of the
consumer or the most recent credit
score of the consumer that was pre-
viously calculated by the consumer re-
porting agency for a purpose related to
the extension of credit;

(EH) The range of possible credit
scores under the model used to gen-
erate the credit score;

(F) The distribution of credit scores

graph containing a minimum of six
bars that illustrates the percentage of
consumers with credit scores within
the range of scores reflected in each
bar, or by other clear and readily un-
derstandable graphical means, or a
clear and readily understandable state-
ment informing the consumer how his
or her credit score compares to the
scores of other consumers. Use of a

score was created;

(H) The name of the consumer report-
ing agency or other person that pro-
vided the credit score;

score has been obtained, but in any
event at or before consummation in the
case of closed-end credit or before the
first transaction is made under an
open-end credit plan.

(4) Multiple credit scores—(i) In Gen-
eral. When a person obtains two or
more credit scores from consumer re-
porting agencies and uses one of those
credit scores in setting the material
terms of credit granted, extended, or
otherwise provided to a consumer, for
example, by using the low, middle,
high, or most recent score, the notice
described in paragraph (e)(1)(dii) of this

The notice may, at the person’s option,
include more than one credit score,
along with the additional information
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this
section for each credit score disclosed.

(ii) Examples. The manner in which
multiple credit scores are to be dis-
closed under this section are substan-
tially identical to the manner set forth

(d)(4)Cii) of this section.

(5) Model form. A model form of the
notice described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)
of this section is contained in 16 CFR
Part B, Appendix B. Appropriate use of
Model Form B4 is deemed to comply
with the requirements of §640.5(e). Use
of the model form is optional.

(f) Credit score not available—(1) In
general. A person is not required to pro-
vide a risk-based pricing notice to a
consumer under §640.3(a) or (c) if the
person:

(i) Regularly obtains credit scores
from a consumer reporting agency and
provides credit score disclosures to
consumers in accordance with para-
graphs (d) or (e) of this section, but a
credit score is not available from the
consumer reporting agency from which
the person regularly obtains credit
scores for a consumer to whom the per-
son grants, extends, or provides credit;

more favorable credit terms;

595
§ 640.6

(D) A statement that not having a
credit score can affect whether the con-
sumer can obtain credit and what the
cost of that credit will be;

(—) A statement that a credit score
about the consumer was not available
from a consumer reporting agency,
which must be identified by name, gen-
erally due to insufficient information
regarding the consumer’s credit his-
tory;

(F) A statement that the consumer is
encouraged to verify the accuracy of
the information contained in the con-
sumer report and has the right to dis-
pute any inaccurate information in the
consumer report;

(G) A statement that federal law
gives the consumer the right to obtain
copies of his or her consumer reports
directly from the consumer reporting
agencies, including a free consumer re-
port from each of the nationwide con-
sumer reporting agencies once during
any 12-month period;

(H) The contact information for the
centralized source from which con-
sumers may obtain their free annual
consumer reports; and

(I) A statement directing consumers
to the web sites of the Board and Fed-
eral Trade Commission to obtain more

(2) Example. A person that uses con-
sumer reports to set the material
terms of non-mortgage credit granted,
extended, or provided to consumers
regularly requests credit scores from a
particular consumer reporting agency
and provides those credit scores and
additional information to consumers to
satisfy the requirements of paragraph
(e) of this section. That consumer re-
porting agency provides to the person a
consumer report on a particular con-
sumer that contains one trade line, but
does not provide the person with a
credit score on that consumer. If the
person does not obtain a credit score
from another consumer reporting agen-
cy and, based in whole or in part on in-
formation in a consumer report,
grants, extends, or provides credit to
the consumer, the person may provide
the notice described in paragraph
(f)Gii) of this section. If, however,
the person obtains a credit score from
another consumer reporting agency,
the person may not rely upon the ex-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

ception in paragraph (f) of this section,
but may satisfy the requirements of
paragraph (e) of this section.

(3) Form of the notice. The notice de-
scribed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this
section must be:

(i) Clear and conspicuous;

(ii) Segregated from other informa-
tion provided to the consumer; and

(iii) Provided to the consumer in
writing and in a form that the con-
sumer may Keep.

(4) Timing. The notice described in
paragraph (f)()dii) of this section
must be provided to the consumer as
soon as reasonably practicable after
the person has requested the credit
score, but in any event not later than
consummation of a transaction in the
case of closed-end credit or when the
first transaction is made under an
open-end credit plan.

(5) Model form. A model form of the
notice described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii)
of this section is contained in 16 CFR
Part 698, Appendix B. Appropriate use
of Model Form B-5 is deemed to com-
ply with the requirements of §640.5(f).
Use of the model form is optional.

§ 640.6 Rules of construction.

For purposes of this part, the fol-
lowing rules of construction apply:

(a) One notice per credit extension. A
consumer is entitled to no more than
one risk-based pricing notice under
§640.38(a) or (c), or one notice under
§640.5(d), (e), or (f), for each grant, ex-
tension, or other provision of credit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if
a consumer has previously received a
risk-based pricing notice in connection
with a grant, extension, or other provi-
sion of credit, another risk-based pric-
ing notice is required if the conditions
set forth in §640.3(d) have been met.

(b) Multi-party transactions—(1) Initial
creditor. The person to whom a credit
obligation is initially payable must
provide the risk-based pricing notice
described in §640.3(a) or (c), or satisfy
the requirements for and provide the
notice required under one of the excep-
tions in § 640.5(d), (e), or (f), even if that
person immediately assigns the credit
agreement to a third party and is not
the source of funding for the credit.

(2) Purchasers or assignees. A pur-
chaser or assignee of a credit contract

596
Federal Trade Commission

with a consumer is not subject to the
requirements of this part and is not re-
quired to provide the risk-based pricing
notice described in §640.3(a) or (c), or
satisfy the requirements for and pro-
vide the notice required under one of
the exceptions in §640.5(d), (e), or (f).

(3) Examples. (i) A consumer obtains
credit to finance the purchase of an
automobile. If the auto dealer is the
person to whom the loan obligation is
initially payable, such as where the
auto dealer is the original creditor
under a retail installment sales con-
tract, the auto dealer must provide the
risk-based pricing notice to the con-
sumer (or satisfy the requirements for
and provide the notice required under
one of the exceptions noted above),
even if the auto dealer immediately as-
signs the loan to a bank or finance
company. The bank or finance com-
pany, which is an assignee, has no duty
to provide a risk-based pricing notice
to the consumer.

(ii) A consumer obtains credit to fi-
nance the purchase of an automobile. If
a bank or finance company is the per-
son to whom the loan obligation is ini-
tially payable, the bank or finance
company must provide the risk-based
pricing notice to the consumer (or sat-
isfy the requirements for and provide
the notice required under one of the ex-
ceptions noted above) based on the
terms offered by that bank or finance
company only. The auto dealer has no
duty to provide a risk-based pricing no-
tice to the consumer. However, the
bank or finance company may comply
with this rule if the auto dealer has
agreed to provide notices to consumers
before consummation pursuant to an
arrangement with the bank or finance
company, as permitted under §640.4(c).

(c) Multiple consumers—(1) Risk-based
pricing notices. In a transaction involv-
ing two or more consumers who are
granted, extended, or otherwise pro-
vided credit, a person must provide a
notice to each consumer to satisfy the
requirements of §640.3(a) or (c). If the
consumers have the same address, a
person may satisfy the requirements
by providing a single notice addressed
to both consumers. If the consumers do
not have the same address, a person
must provide a notice to each con-
sumer.

Pt. 641

(2) Credit score disclosure notices. In a
transaction involving two or more con-
sumers who are granted, extended, or
otherwise provided credit, a person
must provide a separate notice to each
consumer to satisfy the exceptions in
§640.5(d), (e), or (ff). Whether the con-
sumers have the same address or not,
the person must provide a separate no-
tice to each consumer. Each separate
notice must contain only the credit
score(s) of the consumer to whom the
notice is provided, and not the credit
score(s) of the other consumer.

(3) Examples. (i) Two consumers joint-
ly apply for credit with a creditor. The
creditor grants credit to the consumers
on material terms that are materially
less favorable than the most favorable
terms available to other consumers
from the creditor. The two consumers
reside at different addresses. The cred-
itor provides risk-based pricing notices
to satisfy its obligations under this
part. The creditor must provide a risk-
based pricing notice to each consumer
at the address where each consumer re-
sides.

(ii) Two consumers jointly apply for
credit with a creditor. The two con-
sumers reside at the same address. The
creditor obtains credit scores on each
of the two consumer applicants. The
creditor grants credit to the con-
sumers. The creditor provides credit
score disclosure notices to satisfy its
obligations under this part. Even
though the two consumers reside at the
same address, the creditor must pro-
vide a separate credit score disclosure
notice to each of the consumers. Each
notice must contain only the credit
score of the consumer to whom the no-
tice is provided.

substantial difference between the ad-
dress for the consumer that the user
provided to request the consumer re-
port and the address(es) in the agency’s
file for the consumer.

(c) Reasonable belief—(1) Requirement
to form a reasonable belief. A user must
develop and implement reasonable poli-
cies and procedures designed to enable

(2) Examples of reasonable policies and
procedures. (i) Comparing the informa-
tion in the consumer report provided
by the consumer reporting agency with
information the user:

(A) Obtains and uses to verify the
consumer’s identity in accordance with

the consumer report relates to the con-
sumer about whom the user requested
the report;

(ii) Establishes a continuing relation-
ship with the consumer; and

(iii) Regularly and in the ordinary
course of business furnishes informa-
tion to the consumer reporting agency
from which the notice of address dis-
crepancy relating to the consumer was
obtained.

(2) Examples of confirmation methods.
The user may reasonably confirm an
address is accurate by:

(i) Verifying the address with the
consumer about whom it has requested
the report;

(ii) Reviewing its own records to
verify the address of the consumer;

Giii) Verifying the address through
third-party sources; or

(iv) Using other reasonable means.

(3) Timing. The policies and proce-
dures developed in accordance with
paragraph (d)(1) of this section must
provide that the user will furnish the
consumer’s address that the user has
reasonably confirmed is accurate to
the consumer reporting agency de-
scribed in 15 U.S.C. 168la(p) as part of
the information it regularly furnishes
for the reporting period in which it es-
tablishes a relationship with the con-
sumer.

§ 660.1 Scope.

This part applies to furnishers of in-
formation to consumer reporting agen-
cies that are subject to administrative
enforcement of the FCRA by the Fed-
eral Trade Commission pursuant to 15
U.S.C. 1681s(a)(1) (referred to as “fur-
nishers’”).

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

§ 660.2 Definitions.

For purposes of this part and appen-
dix A of this part, the following defini-
tions apply:

(a) Accuracy means that information
that a furnisher provides to a consumer
reporting agency about an account or
other relationship with the consumer
correctly:

(1) Reflects the terms of and liability
for the account or other relationship;

(2) Reflects the consumer’s perform-
ance and other conduct with respect to
the account or other relationship; and

(3) Identifies the appropriate con-
sumer.

(b) Direct dispute means a dispute sub-
mitted directly to a furnisher (includ-
ing a furnisher that is a debt collector)
by a consumer concerning the accuracy
of any information contained in a con-
sumer report and pertaining to an ac-
count or other relationship that the
furnisher has or had with the con-
sumer.

(c) Furnisher means an entity that
furnishes information relating to con-
sumers to one or more consumer re-
porting agencies for inclusion in a con-
sumer report. An entity is not a fur-
nisher when it:

(1) Provides information to a con-
sumer reporting agency solely to ob-
tain a consumer report in accordance
with sections 604(a) and (f) of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act;

(2) Is acting as a “consumer reporting
agency” as defined in section 608(f) of
the Fair Credit Reporting Act;

(3) Is a consumer to whom the fur-
nished information pertains; or

(4) Is a neighbor, friend, or associate
of the consumer, or another individual
with whom the consumer is acquainted
or who may have knowledge about the
consumer, and who provides informa-
tion about the consumer’s character,
general reputation, personal character-
istics, or mode of living in response to
a specific request from a consumer re-
porting agency.

(d) Identity theft has the same mean-
ing as in 16 CFR 608.2(a).

(e) Integrity means that information
that a furnisher provides to a consumer
reporting agency about an account or
other relationship with the consumer:

(1) Is substantiated by the furnisher’s
records at the time it is furnished;

600
Federal Trade Commission

(2) Is furnished in a form and manner
that is designed to minimize the likeli-
hood that the information may be in-
correctly reflected in a consumer re-
port; and

(3) Includes the information in the
furnisher’s possession about the ac-
count or other relationship that the
Commission has:

(i) Determined that the absence of
which would likely be materially mis-
leading in evaluating a consumer’s
creditworthiness, credit standing, cred-
it capacity, character, general reputa-
tion, personal characteristics, or mode
of living; and (Gi) Listed in section
I.(b)(2) Gil) of Appendix A of this part.

§ 660.3 Reasonable policies and proce-
dures concerning the accuracy and
integrity of furnished information.

(a) Policies and procedures. Kach fur-
nisher must establish and implement
reasonable written policies and proce-
dures regarding the accuracy and in-
tegrity of the information relating to
consumers that it furnishes to a con-
sumer reporting agency. The policies
and procedures must be appropriate to
the nature, size, complexity, and scope
of each furnisher’s activities.

(b) Guidelines. Each furnisher must
consider the guidelines in Appendix A
of this part in developing its policies
and procedures required by this sec-
tion, and incorporate those guidelines
that are appropriate.

(c) Reviewing and updating policies and
procedures. Each furnisher must review
its policies and procedures required by
this section periodically and update
them as necessary to ensure their con-
tinued effectiveness.

§660.4 Direct disputes.

(a) General rule. Except as otherwise
provided in this section, a furnisher
must conduct a reasonable investiga-
tion of a direct dispute if it relates to:

(1) The consumer’s liability for a
credit account or other debt with the
furnisher, such as direct disputes relat-
ing to whether there is or has been
identity theft or fraud against the con-
sumer, whether there is individual or
joint liability on an account, or wheth-
er the consumer is an authorized user
of a credit account;

§ 660.4

(2) The terms of a credit account or
other debt with the furnisher, such as
direct disputes relating to the type of
account, principal balance, scheduled
payment amount on an account, or the
amount of the credit limit on an open-
end account;

(3) The consumer’s performance or
other conduct concerning an account
or other relationship with the fur-
nisher, such as direct disputes relating
to the current payment status, high
balance, date a payment was made, the
amount of a payment made, or the date
an account was opened or closed; or

(4) Any other information contained
in a consumer report regarding an ac-
count or other relationship with the
furnisher that bears on the consumer’s
creditworthiness, credit standing, cred-
it capacity, character, general reputa-
tion, personal characteristics, or mode
of living.

(b) Exceptions. The requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section do not
apply to a furnisher if:

(1) The direct dispute relates to:

(i) The consumer’s identifying infor-
mation (other than a direct dispute re-
lating to a consumer’s liability for a
credit account or other debt with the
furnisher, as provided in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section) such as name(s),
date of birth, Social Security number,
telephone number(s), or address(es);

(ii) The identity of past or present
employers;

(iii) Inquiries or requests for a con-
sumer report;

(iv) Information derived from public
records, such as judgments, bank-
ruptcies, liens, and other legal matters

account or other relationship with the
consumer);

(v) Information related to fraud
alerts or active duty alerts; or

(vi) Information provided to a con-
sumer reporting agency by another fur-
nisher; or

(2) The furnisher has a reasonable be-
lief that the direct dispute is submitted
by, is prepared on behalf of the con-
sumer by, or is submitted on a form
supplied to the consumer by, a credit
repair organization, as defined in 15
U.S.C. 1679a(3), or an entity that would
be a credit repair organization, but for
15 U.S.C. 1679a(3)(B)(i).

601
§ 660.4

(c) Direct dispute address. A furnisher
is required to investigate a direct dis-
pute only if a consumer submits a dis-
pute notice to the furnisher at:

(1) The address of a furnisher pro-
vided by a furnisher and set forth on a
consumer report relating to the con-
sumer;

(2) An address clearly and conspicu-
ously specified by the furnisher for sub-
mitting direct disputes that is provided
to the consumer in writing or elec-
tronically (if the consumer has agreed
to the electronic delivery of informa-
tion from the furnisher); or

(3) Any business address of the fur-
nisher if the furnisher has not so speci-
fied and provided an address for sub-
mitting direct disputes under para-
graphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

(d) Direct dispute notice contents. A
dispute notice must include:

(1) Sufficient information to identify
the account or other relationship that
is in dispute, such as an account num-
ber and the name, address, and tele-
phone number of the consumer, if ap-
plicable;

(2) The specific information that the
consumer is disputing and an expla-
nation of the basis for the dispute; and

(3) All supporting documentation or
other information reasonably required
by the furnisher to substantiate the
basis of the dispute. This documenta-
tion may include, for example: a copy
of the relevant portion of the consumer
report that contains the allegedly inac-
curate information; a police report; a
fraud or identity theft affidavit; a
court order; or account statements.

(e) Duty of furnisher after receiving a
direct dispute notice. After receiving a
dispute notice from a consumer pursu-
ant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this
section, the furnisher must:

(1) Conduct a reasonable investiga-
tion with respect to the disputed infor-
mation;

(2) Review all relevant information
provided by the consumer with the dis-
pute notice;

(3) Complete its investigation of the
dispute and report the results of the in-
vestigation to the consumer before the
expiration of the period under section
6ll(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (15 U.S.C. 1681i(a)C.)) within which
a consumer reporting agency would be

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

required to complete its action if the
consumer had elected to dispute the in-
formation under that section; and

(4) If the investigation finds that the
information reported was inaccurate,
promptly notify each consumer report-
ing agency to which the furnisher pro-
vided inaccurate information of that
determination and provide to the con-
sumer reporting agency any correction
to that information that is necessary
to make the information provided by
the furnisher accurate.

(f) Frivolous or irrelevant disputes. (1)
A furnisher is not required to inves-
tigate a direct dispute if the furnisher
has reasonably determined that the
dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A dis-
pute qualifies as frivolous or irrelevant
if:

(i) The consumer did not provide suf-
ficient information to investigate the
disputed information as required by
paragraph (d) of this section;

(ii) The direct dispute is substan-
tially the same as a dispute previously
submitted by or on behalf of the con-
sumer, either directly to the furnisher
or through a consumer reporting agen-
cy, with respect to which the furnisher
has already satisfied the applicable re-
quirements of the Act or this section;
provided, however, that a direct dis-
pute is not substantially the same as a
dispute previously submitted if the dis-
pute includes information listed in
paragraph (d) of this section that had
not previously been provided to the
furnisher; or

(iii) The furnisher is not required to
investigate the direct dispute because
one or more of the exceptions listed in
paragraph (b) of this section applies.

(2) Notice of determination. Upon mak-
ing a determination that a dispute is
frivolous or irrelevant, the furnisher
must notify the consumer of the deter-
mination not later than five business
days after making the determination,
by mail or, if authorized by the con-
sumer for that purpose, by any other
means available to the furnisher.

(3) Contents of notice of determination
that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A
notice of determination that a dispute
is frivolous or irrelevant must include
the reasons for such determination and
identify any information required to
investigate the disputed information,

602
Federal Trade Commission

which notice may consist of a stand-
ardized form describing the general na-
ture of such information.

APPENDIX A TO PART 660—INTERAGENCY
GUIDELINES CONCERNING THE ACCU-
RACY AND INTEGRITY OF INFORMA-
TION FURNISHED TO CONSUMER RE-
PORTING AGENCIES

The Commission encourages voluntary fur-
nishing of information to consumer report-
ing agencies. Section 660.3 of this part re-
quires each furnisher to establish and imple-
ment reasonable written policies and proce-
dures concerning the accuracy and integrity
of the information it furnishes to consumer
reporting agencies. Under §660.3(b), a fur-
nisher must consider the guidelines set forth
below in developing its policies and proce-
dures. In establishing these policies and pro-
cedures, a furnisher may include any of its
existing policies and procedures that are rel-
evant and appropriate. Section 660.3(c) re-
quires each furnisher to review its policies
and procedures periodically and update them
as necessary to ensure their continued effec-
tiveness.

I. NATURE, SCOPE, AND OBJECTIVES OF
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

(a) Nature and Scope. Section 660.3(a) of this
part requires that a furnisher’s policies and
procedures be appropriate to the nature, size,
complexity, and scope of the furnisher’s ac-
tivities. In developing its policies and proce-
dures, a furnisher should consider, for exam-
ple:

(1) The types of business activities in
which the furnisher engages;

(2) The nature and frequency of the infor-
mation the furnisher provides to consumer
reporting agencies; and

(3) The technology used by the furnisher to
furnish information to consumer reporting
agencies.

(b) Objectives. A furnisher’s policies and
procedures should be reasonably designed to
promote the following objectives:

(1) To furnish information about accounts
or other relationships with a consumer that
is accurate, such that the furnished informa-
tion:

(i) Identifies the appropriate consumer;

(ii) Reflects the terms of and liability for
those accounts or other relationships; and

(iii) Reflects the consumer’s performance
and other conduct with respect to the ac-
count or other relationship;

(2) To furnish information about accounts
or other relationships with a consumer that
has integrity, such that the furnished infor-
mation:

(i) Is substantiated by the furnisher’s
records at the time it is furnished;

Pt. 660, App. A

(ii) Is furnished in a form and manner that
is designed to minimize the likelihood that
the information may be incorrectly reflected
in a consumer report; thus, the furnished in-
formation should:

(A) Include appropriate identifying infor-
mation about the consumer to whom it per-
tains; and

(B) Be furnished in a standardized and
clearly understandable form and manner and
with a date specifying the time period to
which the information pertains; and

(iii) Includes the credit limit, if applicable
and in the furnisher’s possession;

(3) To conduct reasonable investigations of
consumer disputes and take appropriate ac-
tions based on the outcome of such inves-
tigations; and

(4) To update the information it furnishes
as necessary to reflect the current status of
the consumer’s account or other relation-
ship, including, for example:

(i) Any transfer of an account (e.g., by sale
or assignment for collection) to a third
party; and

(ii) Any cure of the consumer’s failure to
abide by the terms of the account or other
relationship.

II, ESTABLISHING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
AND PROCEDURES

In establishing and implementing its poli-
cies and procedures, a furnisher should:

(a) Identify practices or activities of the
furnisher that can compromise the accuracy
or integrity of information furnished to con-
sumer reporting agencies, such as by:

(1) Reviewing its existing practices and ac-
tivities, including the technological means
and other methods it uses to furnish infor-
mation to consumer reporting agencies and
the frequency and timing of its furnishing of
information;

(2) Reviewing its historical records relat-
ing to accuracy or integrity or to disputes;
reviewing other information relating to the
accuracy or integrity of information pro-
vided by the furnisher to consumer reporting
agencies; and considering the types of errors,
omissions, or other problems that may have
affected the accuracy or integrity of infor-
mation it has furnished about consumers to
consumer reporting agencies;

(3) Considering any feedback received from
consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or
other appropriate parties;

(4) Obtaining feedback from the furnisher’s
staff; and

(5) Considering the potential impact of the
furnisher’s policies and procedures on con-
sumers.

(bo) Evaluate the effectiveness of existing
policies and procedures of the furnisher re-
garding the accuracy and integrity of infor-
mation furnished to consumer reporting
agencies; consider whether new, additional,

603
Pt. 680

or different policies and procedures are nec-
essary; and consider whether implementa-
tion of existing policies and procedures
should be modified to enhance the accuracy
and integrity of information about con-
sumers furnished to consumer reporting
agencies.

(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of specific
methods (including technological means) the
furnisher uses to provide information to con-
sumer reporting agencies; how those meth-
ods may affect the accuracy and integrity of
the information it provides to consumer re-
porting agencies; and whether new, addi-
tional, or different methods (including tech-
nological means) should be used to provide
information to consumer reporting agencies
to enhance the accuracy and integrity of
that information.

III. SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES

In developing its policies and procedures, a
furnisher should address the following, as ap-
propriate:

(a) Establishing and implementing a sys-
tem for furnishing information about con-
sumers to consumer reporting agencies that
is appropriate to the nature, size, com-
plexity, and scope of the furnisher’s business
operations.

(b) Using standard data reporting formats
and standard procedures for compiling and
furnishing data, where feasible, such as the
electronic transmission of information about
consumers to consumer reporting agencies.

(c) Maintaining records for a reasonable
period of time, not less than any applicable
recordkeeping requirement, in order to sub-
stantiate the accuracy of any information
about consumers it furnishes that is subject
to a direct dispute.

(d) Establishing and implementing appro-
priate internal controls regarding the accu-
racy and integrity of information about con-
sumers furnished to consumer reporting
agencies, such as by implementing standard
procedures and verifying random samples of
information provided to consumer reporting
agencies.

(e) Training staff that participates in ac-
tivities related to the furnishing of informa-
tion about consumers to consumer reporting
agencies to implement the policies and pro-
cedures.

(f) Providing for appropriate and effective
oversight of relevant service providers whose
activities may affect the accuracy or integ-
rity of information about consumers fur-
nished to consumer reporting agencies to en-
sure compliance with the policies and proce-
dures.

(g) Furnishing information about con-
sumers to consumer reporting agencies fol-
lowing mergers, portfolio acquisitions or
sales, or other acquisitions or transfers of
accounts or other obligations in a manner

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

that prevents re-aging of information, dupli-
cative reporting, or other problems that may
similarly affect the accuracy or integrity of
the information furnished.

(h) Deleting, updating, and correcting in-
formation in the furnisher’s records, as ap-
propriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate in-
formation.

(i) Conducting reasonable investigations of
disputes.

(j) Designing technological and other
means of communication with consumer re-
porting agencies to prevent duplicative re-
porting of accounts, erroneous association of
information with the wrong consumer(s), and
other occurrences that may compromise the
accuracy or integrity of information pro-
vided to consumer reporting agencies.

(k) Providing consumer reporting agencies
with sufficient identifying information in
the furnisher’s possession about each con-
sumer about whom information is furnished
to enable the consumer reporting agency
properly to identify the consumer.

(1) Conducting a periodic evaluation of its
own practices, consumer reporting agency
practices of which the furnisher is aware, in-
vestigations of disputed information, correc-
tions of inaccurate information, means of
communication, and other factors that may
affect the accuracy or integrity of informa-
tion furnished to consumer reporting agen-
cies.

(m) Complying with applicable require-
ments under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
and its implementing regulations.

otherwise noted.
§680.1 Purpose and scope.

(a) Purpose. The purpose of this part
is to implement section 214 of the Fair

604
Federal Trade Commission

and Accu-rate Credit Transactions Act
of 2008, which (by adding section 624 to
Fair Credit Reporting Act) regulates
the use, for marketing solicitation pur-
poses, of consumer information pro-
vided by persons affiliated with the
person making the solicitation.

(b) Scope. This part applies to any
person over which the Federal Trade
Commission has jurisdiction that uses
information from its affiliates for the
purpose of marketing solicitations, or
provides information to its affiliates
for that purpose.

§680.2 Examples.

The examples in this part are not ex-
clusive. Compliance with an example,
to the extent applicable, constitutes
compliance with this part. Examples in
a paragraph illustrate only the issue
described in the paragraph and do not
illustrate any other issue that may
arise in this part.

$680.3 Definitions.

As used in this part:

(a) Act. The term “Act” means the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.
1681 et seq.).

(ob) Affiliate. The term “affiliate”
means any company that is related by
common ownership or common cor-
porate control with another company.

(c) Clear and conspicuous. The term
“clear and conspicuous” means reason-
ably under-standable and designed to
call attention to the nature and signifi-
cance of the information presented.

(d) Common ownership or common cor-
porate control. The term “common own-
ership or common corporate control”
means a relationship between two com-
panies under which:

(1) One company has, with respect to
the other company:

(i) Ownership, control, or the power
to vote 25 percent or more of the out-
standing shares of any class of voting
security of a company, directly or indi-
rectly, or acting through one or more
other persons;

(ii) Control in any manner over the
election of a majority of the directors,
trustees, or general partners (or indi-
viduals exercising similar functions) of
a company; or

(iii) The power to exercise, directly
or indirectly, a controlling influence

§ 680.3

over the management or policies of a
company, as the Commission deter-
mines; or

(2) Any person has, with respect to
both companies, a relationship de-
scribed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through
(d)(1)Ciii) of this section.

(e) Company. The term “company”
means any corporation, limited liabil-
ity company, business trust, general or
limited partnership, association, or
similar organization.

(f) Concise—(1) In general. The term
“concise” means a reasonably brief ex-
pression or statement.

(2) Combination with other required dis-
closures. A notice required by this part
may be concise even if it is combined
with other disclosures required or au-
thorized by federal or state law.

(g) Consumer. The term “consumer”
means an individual.

(h) Eligibility information. The term
“eligibility information” means any in-
formation the communication of which
would be a consumer report if the ex-
clusions from the definition of “con-
sumer report” in section 608(d)(2)(A) of
the Act did not apply. Eligibility infor-
mation does not include aggregate or
blind data that does not contain per-
sonal identifiers such as account num-
bers, names, or addresses.

(i) Person. The term “person” means
any individual, partnership, corpora-
tion, trust, estate, cooperative, asso-
ciation, government or governmental
subdivision or agency, or other entity.

(j) Pre-existing business relationship—
(1) In general. The term “pre-existing
business relationship” means a rela-
tionship between a person, or a per-
son’s licensed agent, and a consumer
based on—

(i) A financial contract between the
person and the consumer which is in
force on the date on which the con-
sumer is sent a solicitation covered by
this part;

(ii) The purchase, rental, or lease by
the consumer of the persons’ goods or
services, or a financial transaction (in-
cluding holding an active account or a
policy in force or having another con-
tinuing relationship) between the con-
sumer and the person, during the 18-
month period immediately preceding
the date on which the consumer is sent
a solicitation covered by this part; or

605
§ 680.3

(iii) An inquiry or application by the
consumer regarding a product or serv-
ice offered by that person during the
three-month period immediately pre-
ceding the date on which the consumer
is sent a solicitation covered by this
part.

(2) Examples of pre-existing business re-
lationships. (i) If a consumer has an ex-
isting loan account with a creditor, the
creditor has a pre-existing business re-
lationship with the consumer and can
use eligibility information it receives
from its affiliates to make solicita-
tions to the consumer about its prod-
ucts or services.

(ii) If a consumer obtained a mort-
gage from a mortgage lender, but refi-
nanced the mortgage loan with a dif-
ferent lender when the mortgage loan
came due, the first mortgage lender
has a pre-existing business relationship
with the consumer and can use eligi-
bility information it receives from its
affiliates to make solicitations to the
consumer about its products or serv-
ices for 18 months after the date the
outstanding balance of the loan is paid
and the loan is closed.

(iii) If a consumer obtains a mort-
gage, the mortgage lender has a pre-ex-
isting business relationship with the
consumer. If the mortgage lender sells
the consumer’s entire loan to an inves-
tor, the mortgage lender has a pre-ex-
isting business relationship with the
consumer and can use eligibility infor-
mation it receives from its affiliates to
make solicitations to the consumer
about its products or services for 18
months after the date it sells the loan,
and the investor has a_ pre-existing
business relationship with the con-
sumer upon purchasing the loan. If,
however, the mortgage lender sells a
fractional interest in the consumer’s
loan to an investor but also retains an
ownership interest in the loan, the
mortgage lender continues to have a
pre-existing business relationship with
the consumer, but the investor does
not have a pre-existing business rela-
tionship with the consumer. If the
mortgage lender retains ownership of
the loan, but sells ownership of the
servicing rights to the consumer’s
loan, the mortgage lender continues to
have a pre-existing business relation-
ship with the consumer. The purchaser

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

of the servicing rights also has a pre-
existing business relationship with the
consumer as of the date it purchases
ownership of the servicing rights, but
only if it collects payments from or
otherwise deals directly with the con-
sumer on a continuing basis.

(iv) If a consumer applies to a cred-
itor for a product or service that it of-
fers, but does not obtain a product or
service from or enter into a financial
contract or transaction with the cred-
itor, the creditor has a pre-existing
business relationship with the con-
sumer and can therefore use eligibility
information it receives from an a/ffil-
iate to make solicitations to the con-
sumer about its products or services
for three months after the date of the
application.

(v) If a consumer makes a telephone
inquiry to a creditor about its products
or services and provides contact infor-
mation to the creditor, but does not
obtain a product or service from or
enter into a financial contract or
transaction with the creditor, the cred-
itor has a pre-existing business rela-
tionship with the consumer and can
therefore use eligibility information it
receives from an affiliate to make so-
licitations to the consumer about its
products or services for three months
after the date of the inquiry.

(vi) If a consumer makes an inquiry
to a creditor by e-mail about its prod-
ucts or services, but does not obtain a
product or service from or enter into a
financial contract or transaction with
the creditor, the creditor has a pre-ex-
isting business relationship with the
consumer and can therefore use eligi-
bility information it receives from an
affiliate to make solicitations to the
consumer about its products or serv-
ices for three months after the date of
the inquiry.

(vii) If a consumer has an existing re-
lationship with a creditor that is part
of a group of affiliated companies,
makes a telephone call to the central-
ized call center for the group of affili-
ated companies to inquire about prod-
ucts or services offered by the insur-
ance affiliate, and provides contact in-
formation to the call center, the call
constitutes an inquiry to the insurance
affiliate that offers those products or
services. The insurance affiliate has a

606
Federal Trade Commission

pre-existing business relationship with
the consumer and can therefore use eli-
gibility information it receives from
its affiliated creditor to make solicita-
tions to the consumer about its prod-
ucts or services for three months after
the date of the inquiry.

(3) Examples where no pre-existing busi-
ness relationship is created. (i) If a con-
sumer makes a telephone call to a cen-
tralized call center for a group of affili-
ated companies to inquire about the
consumer’s existing account with a
creditor, the call does not constitute
an inquiry to any affiliate other than
the creditor that holds the consumer’s
account and does not establish a pre-
existing business relationship between
the consumer and any affiliate of the
account-holding creditor.

(ii) If a consumer who has a loan ac-
count with a creditor makes a tele-
phone call to an af-filiate of the cred-
itor to ask about the affiliate’s retail
locations and hours, but does not make
an inquiry about the affiliate’s prod-
ucts or services, the call does not con-
stitute an inquiry and does not estab-
lish a pre-existing business relation-
ship between the consumer and the af-
filiate. Also, the affiliate’s capture of
the consumer’s telephone number does
not constitute an inquiry and does not
establish a pre-existing business rela-
tionship between the consumer and the
affiliate.

(iii) If a consumer makes a telephone
call to a creditor in response to an ad-
vertisement that offers a free pro-
motional item to consumers who call a
toll-free number, but the advertise-
ment does not indicate that creditor’s
products or services will be marketed
to consumers who call in response, the
call does not create a pre-existing busi-
ness relationship between the con-
sumer and the creditor because the
consumer has not made an inquiry
about a product or service offered by
the creditor, but has merely responded
to an offer for a free promotional item.

(k) Solicitation—(1) In general. The
term “solicitation” means the mar-
keting of a product or service initiated
by a person to a particular consumer
that is—

(i) Based on eligibility information
communicated to that person by its af-
filiate as described in this part; and

§ 680.21

(ii) Intended to encourage the con-
sumer to purchase or obtain such prod-
uct or service.

(2) Exclusion of marketing directed at
the general public. A solicitation does
not include marketing communica-
tions that are directed at the general
public. For example, television, general
circulation magazine, and billboard ad-
vertisements do not constitute solici-
tations, even if those communications
are intended to encourage consumers
to purchase products and services from
the person initiating the communica-
tions.

(3) Examples of solicitations. A solicita-
tion would include, for example, a tele-
marketing call, direct mail, e-mail, or
other form of marketing communica-
tion directed to a particular consumer
that is based on eligibility information
received from an affiliate.

(1) You means a person described in
§ 680.1(b).

§§ 680.4-680.20 [Reserved]

§680.21 Affiliate
and exceptions.

marketing opt-out

(a) Initial notice and opt-out require-
ment—(1) In general. You may not use
eligibility information about a con-
sumer that you receive from an affil-
iate to make a solicitation for mar-
keting purposes to the consumer, un-
less—

(i) It is clearly and conspicuously dis-
closed to the consumer in writing or, if
the consumer agrees, electronically, in
a concise notice that you may use eli-
gibility information about that con-
sumer received from an affiliate to
make solicitations for marketing pur-
poses to the consumer;

(ii) The consumer is provided a rea-
sonable opportunity and a reasonable
and simple method to “opt out,” or pro-
hibit you from using eligibility infor-
mation to make solicitations for mar-
keting purposes to the consumer; and

(iii) The consumer has not opted out.

(2) Example. A consumer has a home-
owner’s insurance policy with an insur-
ance company. The insurance company
furnishes eligibility information about
the consumer to its affiliated creditor.
Based on that eligibility information,
the creditor wants to make a solicita-
tion to the consumer about its home

607
§ 680.21

equity loan products. The creditor does
not have a pre-existing business rela-
tionship with the consumer and none of
the other exceptions apply. The cred-
itor is prohibited from using eligibility
information received from its insur-
ance affiliate to make solicitations to
the consumer about its home equity
loan products unless the consumer is
given a notice and opportunity to opt
out and the consumer does not opt out.

(3) Affiliates who may provide the no-
tice. The notice required by this para-
graph (a) must be provided:

(i) By an affiliate that has or has pre-
viously had a pre-existing business re-
lationship with the consumer; or

(ii) As part of a joint notice from two
or more members of an affiliated group
of companies, provided that at least
one of the affiliates on the joint notice
has or has previously had a pre-exist-
ing business relationship with the con-
sumer.

(b) Making solicitations—() In general.
For purposes of this part, you make a
solicitation for marketing purposes if—

(i) You receive eligibility informa-
tion from an affiliate;

(ii) You use that eligibility informa-
tion to do one or more of the following:

(A) Identify the consumer or type of
consumer to receive a solicitation;

(B) Establish criteria used to select
the consumer to receive a solicitation;
or

(C) Decide which of your products or
services to market to the consumer or
tailor your solicitation to that con-
sumer; and

(iii) As a result of your use of the eli-
gibility information, the consumer is
provided a solicitation.

(2) Receiving eligibility information
from an affiliate, including through a
common database. You may receive eli-
gibility information from an affiliate
in various ways, including when the af-
filiate places that information into a
common database that you may access.

(3) Receipt or use of eligibility informa-
tion by your service provider. Except as
provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this sec-
tion, you receive or use an affiliate’s
eligibility information if a service pro-
vider acting on your behalf (whether an
affiliate or a nonaffiliated third party)
receives or uses that information in
the manner described in paragraphs

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

(b)(1)G) or (b)C)Gi) of this section. All
relevant facts and circumstances will
determine whether a person is acting
as your service provider when it re-
ceives or uses an affiliate’s eligibility
information in connection with mar-
keting your products and services.

(4) Use by an affiliate of its own eligi-
bility information. Unless you have used
eligibility information that you re-
ceive from an affiliate in the manner
described in paragraph (b)(1)di) of this
section, you do not make a solicitation
subject to this part if your affiliate:

(i) Uses its own eligibility informa-
tion that it obtained in connection
with a pre-existing business relation-
ship it has or had with the consumer to
market your products or services to
the consumer; or

(ii) Directs its service provider to use
the affiliate’s own eligibility informa-
tion that it obtained in connection
with a pre-existing business relation-
ship it has or had with the consumer to
market your products or services to
the consumer, and you do not commu-
nicate directly with the service pro-
vider regarding that use.

(5) Use of eligibility information by a
service provider—(i) In general. You do
not make a solicitation subject to this
part if a service provider (including an
affiliated or third-party service pro-
vider that maintains or accesses a com-
mon database that you may access) re-
ceives eligibility information from
your affiliate that your affiliate ob-
tained in connection with a pre-exist-
ing business relationship it has or had
with the consumer and uses that eligi-
bility information to market your
products or services to the consumer,
so long as—

(A) Your affiliate controls access to
and use of its eligibility information by
the service provider (including the
right to establish the specific terms
and conditions under which the service
provider may use such information to
market your products or services);

(B) Your affiliate establishes specific
terms and conditions under which the
service provider may access and use
the affiliate’s eligibility information to
market your products and services (or
those of affiliates generally) to the
consumer, such as the identity of the
affiliated companies whose products or

608
Federal Trade Commission

services may be marketed to the con-
sumer by the service provider, the
types of products or services of affili-
ated companies that may be marketed,
and the number of times the consumer
may receive marketing materials, and
periodically evaluates the service pro-
vider’s compliance with those terms
and conditions;

(C) Your affiliate requires the service
provider to implement reasonable poli-
cies and procedures designed to ensure
that the service provider uses the af-
filiate’s eligibility information in ac-
cordance with the terms and conditions
established by the affiliate relating to
the marketing of your products or
services;

(D) Your affiliate is identified on or
with the marketing materials provided
to the consumer; and

(EK) You do not directly use your af-
filiate’s eligibility information in the
manner described in paragraph (b)(1)dii)
of this section.

(ii) Writing requirements. (A) The re-
quirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A)
and (C) of this section must be set
forth in a written agreement between
your affiliate and the service provider;
and

(B) The specific terms and conditions
established by your affiliate as pro-
vided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this
section must be set forth in writing.

(6) Examples of making solicitations. (i)
A consumer has a loan account with a
creditor, which is affiliated with an in-
surance company. The insurance com-
pany receives eligibility information
about the consumer from the creditor.
The insurance company uses that eligi-
bility information to identify the con-
sumer to receive a solicitation about
insurance products, and, as a result,
the insurance company provides a so-
licitation to the consumer about its in-
surance products. Pursuant to para-
graph (b)(1) of this section, the insur-
ance company has made a solicitation
to the consumer.

(ii) The same facts as in the example
in paragraph (b)(6)(Gi) of this section,
except that after using the eligibility
information to identify the consumer
to receive a solicitation about insur-
ance products, the insurance company
asks the creditor to send the solicita-
tion to the consumer and the creditor

§ 680.21

does so. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of
this section, the insurance company
has made a solicitation to the con-
sumer because it used eligibility infor-
mation about the consumer that it re-
ceived from an affiliate to identify the
consumer to receive a_ solicitation
about its products or services, and, as a
result, a solicitation was provided to
the consumer about the insurance com-
pany’s products.

(iii) The same facts as in the example
in paragraph (b)(6)(Gi) of this section,
except that eligibility information
about consumers that have loan ac-
counts with the creditor is placed into
a common database that all members
of the affiliated group of companies
may independently access and use.
Without using the creditor’s eligibility
information, the insurance company
develops selection criteria and provides
those criteria, marketing materials,
and related instructions to the cred-
itor. The creditor reviews eligibility
information about its own consumers
using the selection criteria provided by
the insurance company to determine
which consumers should receive the in-
surance company’s marketing mate-
rials and sends marketing materials
about the insurance company’s prod-
ucts to those consumers. Even though
the insurance company has received
eligibility information through the
common database as provided in para-
graph (b)@Q) of this section, it did not
use that information to identify con-
sumers or establish selection criteria;
instead, the creditor used its own eligi-
bility information. Therefore, pursuant
to paragraph (b)(4)qj) of this section,
the insurance company has not made a
solicitation to the consumer.

(iv) The same facts as in the example
in paragraph (b)(6)dGii) of this section,
except that the creditor provides the
insurance company’s criteria to the
creditor’s service provider and directs
the service provider to use the credi-
tor’s eligibility information to identify
creditor consumers who meet the cri-
teria and to send the insurance com-
pany’s marketing materials to those
consumers. The insurance company
does not communicate directly with
the service provider regarding the use
of the creditor’s information to market

609
§ 680.21

its products to the creditor’s con-
sumers. Pursuant to paragraph
(b)(4)Gi) of this section, the insurance
company has not made a solicitation to
the consumer.

(v) An affiliated group of companies
includes a creditor, an insurance com-
pany, and a service provider. Each af-
filiate in the group places information
about its consumers into a common
database. The service provider has ac-
cess to all information in the common
database. The creditor controls access
to and use of its eligibility information
by the service provider. This control is
set forth in a written agreement be-
tween the creditor and the service pro-
vider. The written agreement also re-
quires the service provider to establish
reasonable policies and procedures de-
signed to ensure that the service pro-
vider uses the creditor’s eligibility in-
formation in accordance with specific
terms and conditions established by
the creditor relating to the marketing
of the products and services of all af-
filiates, including the insurance com-
pany. In a separate written commu-
nication, the creditor specifies the
terms and conditions under which the
service provider may use the creditor’s
eligibility information to market the
insurance company’s products and
services to the creditor’s consumers.
The specific terms and conditions are:
a list of affiliated companies (including
the insurance company) whose prod-
ucts or services may be marketed to
the creditor’s consumers by the service
provider; the specific products or types
of products that may be marketed to
the creditor’s consumers by the service
provider; the categories of eligibility
information that may be used by the
service provider in marketing products
or services to the creditor’s consumers;
the types or categories of the creditor’s
consumers to whom the service pro-
vider may market products or services
of creditor affiliates; the number and/
or types of marketing communications
that the service provider may send to
the creditor’s consumers; and the
length of time during which the service
provider may market the prod-ucts or
services of the creditor’s affiliates to
its consumers. The creditor periodi-
cally evaluates the service provider’s
compliance with these terms and con-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

ditions. The insurance company asks
the service provider to market insur-
ance products to certain consumers
who have loan accounts with the cred-
itor. Without using the creditor’s eligi-
bility information, the insurance com-
pany develops selection criteria and
provides those criteria, marketing ma-
terials, and related instructions to the
service provider. The service provider
uses the creditor’s eligibility informa-
tion from the common database to
identify the creditor’s consumers to
whom insurance products will be mar-
keted. When the insurance company’s
marketing materials are provided to
the identified consumers, the name of
the creditor is displayed on the insur-
ance marketing materials, an introduc-
tory letter that accompanies the mar-
keting materials, an account state-
ment that accompanies the marketing
materials, or the envelope containing
the marketing materials. The _ re-
quirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this
section have been satisfied, and the in-
surance company has not made a solic-
itation to the consumer.

(vi) The same facts as in the example
in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section,
except that the terms and conditions
permit the service provider to use the
creditor’s eligibility information to
market the products and services of
other affiliates to the creditor’s con-
sumers whenever the service provider
deems it appropriate to do so. The serv-
ice provider uses the creditor’s eligi-
bility information in accordance with
the discretion af-forded to it by the
terms and conditions. Because the
terms and conditions are not specific,
the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of
this section have not been satisfied.

(c) Exceptions. The provisions of this
part do not apply to you if you use eli-
gibility information that you receive
from an affiliate:

(1) To make a solicitation for mar-
keting purposes to a consumer with
whom you have a pre-existing business
relationship;

(2) To facilitate communications to
an individual for whose benefit you
provide employee benefit or other serv-
ices pursuant to a contract with an em-
ployer related to and arising out of the
current employment relationship or

610
Federal Trade Commission

status of the individual as a partici-
pant or beneficiary of an employee ben-
efit plan;

(3) To perform services on behalf of
an affiliate, except that this paragraph
shall not be construed as permitting
you to send solicitations on behalf of
an affiliate if the affiliate would not be
permitted to send the solicitation as a
result of the election of the consumer
to opt out under this part;

(4) In response to a communication
about your products or services initi-
ated by the consumer;

(5) In response to an authorization or
request by the consumer to receive so-
licitations; or

(6) If your compliance with this part
would prevent you from complying
with any provision of State insurance
laws pertaining to unfair discrimina-
tion in any State in which you are law-
fully doing business.

(d) Examples of exceptions—(1) Example
of the pre-existing business relationship
exception. A consumer has a loan ac-
count with a creditor. The consumer
also has a relationship with the credi-
tor’s securities affiliate for manage-
ment of the consumer’s securities port-
folio. The creditor receives eligibility
information about the consumer from
its securities affiliate and uses that in-
formation to make a solicitation to the
consumer about the creditor’s wealth
management services. The creditor
may make this solicitation even if the
consumer has not been given a notice
and opportunity to opt out because the
creditor has a pre-existing business re-
lationship with the consumer.

(2) Examples of service provider excep-
tion. (i) A consumer has an insurance
policy issued by an insurance company.
The insurance company furnishes eligi-
bility information about the consumer
to an affiliated creditor. Based on that
eligibility information, the creditor
wants to make a solicitation to the
consumer about its credit products.
The creditor does not have a pre-exist-
ing business relationship with the con-
sumer and none of the other exceptions
in para-graph (c) of this section apply.
The consumer has been given an opt-
out notice and has elected to opt out of
receiving such solicitations. The cred-
itor asks a service provider to send the
solicitation to the consumer on its be-

§ 680.21

half. The service provider may not send
the solicitation on behalf of the cred-
itor because, as a result of the con-
sumer’s opt-out election, the creditor
is not permitted to make the solicita-
tion.

(ii) The same facts as in paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of this section, except the con-
sumer has been given an opt-out no-
tice, but has not elected to opt out.
The creditor asks a service provider to
send the solicitation to the consumer
on its behalf. The service provider may
send the solicitation on behalf of the
creditor because, as a result of the con-
sumer’s not opting out, the creditor is
permitted to make the solicitation.

(3) Examples of consumer-initiated com-
munications. (i) A consumer who has a
consumer loan account with a finance
company initiates a communication
with the creditor’s mortgage lending
affiliate to request information about a
mortgage. The mortgage lender affil-
iate may use eligibility information
about the consumer it obtains from the
finance company or any other affiliate
to make solicitations regarding mort-
gage products in response to the con-
sumer-initiated communication.

(ii) A consumer who has a loan ac-
count with a creditor contacts the
creditor to request information about
how to save and invest for a child’s col-
lege education without specifying the
type of product in which the consumer
may be interested. Information about a
range of different products or services
offered by the creditor and one or more
affiliates of the creditor may be re-
sponsive to that communication. Such
products or services may include the
following: mutual funds offered by the
creditor’s mutual fund affil-iate; sec-
tion 529 plans offered by the creditor,
its mutual fund affiliate, or another se-
curities affiliate; or trust services of-
fered by a different creditor in the af-
filiated group. Any affiliate offering in-
vestment products or services that
would be responsive to the consumer’s
request for information about saving
and investing for a child’s college edu-
cation may use eligibility information
to make solicitations to the consumer
in response to this communication.

611
§ 680.22

(iii) A credit card issuer makes a
marketing call to the consumer with-
out using eligibility information re-
ceived from an affiliate. The issuer
leaves a voice-mail message that in-
vites the consumer to call a toll-free
number to apply for the issuer’s credit
card. If the consumer calls the toll-free
number to inquire about the credit
card, the call is a consumer-initiated
communication about a product or
service and the credit card issuer may
now use eligibility information it re-
ceives from its affiliates to make so-
licitations to the consumer.

(iv) A consumer calls a creditor to
ask about retail locations and hours,
but does not request information about
products or services. The creditor may
not use eligibility information it re-
ceives from an affiliate to make solici-
tations to the consumer about its prod-
ucts or services because the consumer-
initiated communication does not re-
late to the creditor’s products or serv-
ices. Thus, the use of eligibility infor-
mation received from an _ affiliate
would not be responsive to the commu-
nication and the exception does not
apply.

(v) A consumer calls a creditor to ask
about office locations and hours. The
customer service representative asks
the consumer if there is a particular
product or service about which the con-
sumer is seeking information. The con-
sumer responds that the consumer
wants to stop in and find out about sec-
ond mortgage loans. The customer
service representative offers to provide
that information by telephone and
mail additional information and appli-
cation materials to the consumer. The
consumer agrees and provides or con-
firms contact information for receipt
of the materials to be mailed. The
creditor may use eligibility informa-
tion it receives from an affiliate to
make solicitations to the consumer
about mortgage loan products because
such solicitations respond to the con-
sumer-initiated communication about
products or services.

(4) Examples of consumer authorization
or request for solicitations. (i) A con-
sumer who obtains a mortgage from a
mortgage lender authorizes or requests
information about homeowner’s insur-
ance offered by the mortgage lender’s

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

insurance affiliate. Such authorization
or request, whether given to the mort-
gage lender or to the insurance affil-
iate, would permit the insurance a/ffil-
jate to use eligibility information
about the consumer it obtains from the
mortgage lender or any other affiliate
to make solicitations to the consumer
about homeowner’s insurance.

(ii) A consumer completes an online
application to apply for a credit card
from a department store. The store’s
online application contains a blank
check box that the consumer may
check to authorize or request informa-
tion from the store’s affiliates. The
consumer checks the box. The con-
sumer has authorized or requested so-
licitations from store’s affiliates.

(iii) A consumer completes an online
application to apply for a credit card
from a department store. The store’s
online application contains a pre-se-
lected check box indicating that the
consumer authorizes or requests infor-
mation from the store’s affiliates. The
consumer does not deselect the check
box. The consumer has not authorized
or requested solicitations from the
store’s affiliates.

(iv) The terms and conditions of a
credit account agreement contain
preprinted boilerplate language stating
that by applying to open an account
the consumer authorizes or requests to
receive solicitations from the credi-
tor’s affiliates. The consumer has not
authorized or requested solicitations
from the creditor’s affiliates.

(e) Relation to affiliate-sharing notice
and opt-out. Nothing in this part limits
the responsibility of a person to com-
ply with the notice and opt-out provi-
sions of section 6038(d)(2)(A)Giii) of the
Act where applicable.

§ 680.22 Scope and duration of opt-out.

(a) Scope of opt-out—(1) In general. Exx-
cept as otherwise provided in this sec-
tion, the consumer’s election to opt
out prohibits any affiliate covered by
the opt-out notice from using eligi-
bility information received from an-
other affiliate as described in the no-
tice to make solicitations to the con-
sumer.

(2) Continuing relationship—(i) In gen-
eral. If the consumer establishes a con-
tinuing relationship with you or your

612
Federal Trade Commission

affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply
to eligibility information obtained in
connection with—

(A) A single continuing relationship
or multiple continuing relationships
that the consumer establishes with you
or your affiliates, including continuing
relationships established subsequent to
delivery of the opt-out notice, so long
as the notice adequately describes the
continuing relationships covered by
the opt-out; or

(B) Any other transaction between
the consumer and you or your affiliates
as described in the notice.

(ii) Examples of continuing relation-
ships. A consumer has a continuing re-
lationship with you or your affiliate if
the consumer—

(A) Opens a credit account with you
or your affiliate;

(B) Obtains a loan for which you or
your affiliate owns the _ servicing
rights;

(C) Purchases an insurance product
from you or your affiliate;

(D) Holds an investment product
through you or your affiliate, such as
when you act or your affiliate acts as a
custodian for securities or for assets in
an individual retirement arrangement;

(KE) Enters into an agreement or un-
derstanding with you or your affiliate
whereby you or your affiliate under-
takes to arrange or broker a home
mortgage loan for the consumer;

(F) Enters into a lease of personal
property with you or your affiliate; or

(G) Obtains financial, investment, or
economic advisory services from you or
your affiliate for a fee.

(3) No continuing relationship—(i) In
general. If there is no continuing rela-
tionship between a consumer and you
or your affiliate, and you or your a/ffil-
iate obtain eligibility information
about a consumer in connection with a
transaction with the consumer, such as
an isolated transaction or a credit ap-
plication that is denied, an opt-out no-
tice provided to the consumer only ap-
plies to eligibility information ob-
tained in connection with that trans-
action.

(ii) Examples of isolated transactions.
An isolated transaction occurs if—

(A) The consumer uses your or your
affiliate’s ATM to withdraw cash from

§ 680.22

an account at a financial institution;
or

(B) You or your affiliate sells the
consumer a money order, airline tick-
ets, travel insurance, or traveler’s
checks in isolated transactions.

(4) Menu of alternatives. A consumer
may be given the opportunity to
choose from a menu of alternatives
when electing to prohibit solicitations,
such as by electing to prohibit solicita-
tions from certain types of affiliates
covered by the opt-out notice but not
other types of affiliates covered by the
notice, electing to prohibit solicita-
tions based on certain types of eligi-
bility information but not other types
of eligibility information, or electing
to prohibit solicitations by certain
methods of delivery but not other
methods of delivery. However, one of
the alternatives must allow the con-
sumer to prohibit all solicitations from
all of the affiliates that are covered by
the notice.

(5) Special rule for a notice following
termination of all continuing relation-
ships—(i) In general. A consumer must
be given a new opt-out notice if, after
all continuing relationships with you
or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the
consumer subsequently establishes an-
other continuing relationship with you
or your affiliate(s) and the consumer’s
eligibility information is to be used to
make a solicitation. The new opt-out
notice must apply, at a minimum, to
eligibility information obtained in con-
nection with the new continuing rela-
tionship. Consistent with paragraph (b)
of this section, the consumer’s decision
not to opt out after receiving the new
opt-out notice would not override a
prior opt-out election by the consumer
that applies to eligibility information
obtained in connection with a termi-
nated relationship, regardless of
whether the new opt-out notice applies
to eligibility information obtained in
connection with the terminated rela-
tionship.

(ii) Example. A consumer has an auto-
mobile loan account with a creditor
that is part of an affiliated group. The
consumer pays off the loan. After pay-
ing off the loan, the consumer subse-
quently obtains a second mortgage
loan from the creditor. The consumer

613
§ 680.23

must be given a new notice and oppor-
tunity to opt out before the creditor’s
affiliates may make solicitations to
the consumer using eligibility informa-
tion obtained by the creditor in con-
nection with the new mortgage rela-
tionship, regardless of whether the con-
sumer opted out in connection with the
automobile loan account.

(b) Duration of opt-out. The election
of a consumer to opt out must be effec-
tive for a period of at least five years
(the “opt-out period”) beginning when
the consumer’s opt-out election is re-
ceived and implemented, unless the
consumer subsequently revokes the
opt-out in writing or, if the consumer
agrees, electronically. An opt-out pe-
riod of more than five years may be es-
tablished, including an opt-out period
that does not expire unless revoked by
the consumer.

(c) Time of opt-out. A consumer may
opt out at any time.

§680.23 Contents of opt-out notice;
consolidated and equivalent no-
tices.

(a) Contents of opt-out notice—(1) In
general. A notice must be clear, con-
spicuous, and concise, and must accu-
rately disclose:

(i) The name of the affiliate(s) pro-
viding the notice. If the notice is pro-
vided jointly by multiple affiliates and
each affiliate shares a common name,
such as “ABC,” then the notice may in-
dicate that it is being provided by mul-
tiple companies with the ABC name or
multiple companies in the ABC group
or family of companies, for example, by
stating that the notice is provided by
“all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC
banking, credit card, insurance, and se-
curities companies,” or by listing the
name of each affiliate providing the no-
tice. But if the affiliates providing the
joint notice do not all share a common
name, then the notice must either sep-
arately identify each affiliate by name
or identify each of the common names
used by those affiliates, for example,
by stating that the notice is provided
by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies”
or by “the ABC banking and credit card
companies and the XYZ insurance com-
panies;”

(ii) A list of the affiliates or types of
affiliates whose use of eligibility infor-

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

mation is covered by the notice, which
may include companies that become af-
filiates after the notice is provided to
the consumer. If each affiliate covered
by the notice shares a common name,
such as “ABC,” then the notice may in-
dicate that it applies to multiple com-
panies with the ABC name or multiple
companies in the ABC group or family
of companies, for example, by stating
that the notice is provided by “all of
the ABC companies,” “the ABC bank-
ing, credit card, insurance, and securi-
ties companies,” or by listing the name
of each affiliate providing the notice.
But if the affiliates covered by the no-
tice do not all share a common name,
then the notice must either separately
identify each covered affiliate by name
or identify each of the common names
used by those affiliates, for example,
by stating that the notice applies to
“all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or
to “the ABC banking and credit card
companies and the XYZ insurance com-
panies;”

(iii) A general description of the
types of eligibility information that
may be used to make solicitations to
the consumer;

(iv) That the consumer may elect to
limit the use of eligibility information
to make solicitations to the consumer;

(v) That the consumer’s election will
apply for the specified period of time
stated in the notice and, if applicable,
that the consumer will be allowed to
renew the election once that period ex-
pires;

(vi) If the notice is provided to con-
sumers who may have previously opted
out, such as if a notice is provided to
consumers annually, that the con-
sumer who has chosen to limit solicita-
tions does not need to act again until
the consumer receives a renewal no-
tice; and

(vii) A reasonable and simple method
for the consumer to opt out.

(2) Joint relationships. (i) If two or
more consumers jointly obtain a prod-
uct or service, a single opt-out notice
may be provided to the joint con-
sumers. Any of the joint consumers
may exercise the right to opt out.

(ii) The opt-out notice must explain
how an opt-out direction by a joint
consumer will be treated. An opt-out
direction by a joint consumer may be

614
Federal Trade Commission

treated as applying to all of the associ-
ated joint consumers, or each joint
consumer may be permitted to opt out
separately. If each joint consumer is
permitted to opt out separately, one of
the joint consumers must be permitted
to opt out on behalf of all of the joint
consumers and the joint consumers
must be permitted to exercise their
separate rights to opt out in a single
response.

(iii) It is impermissible to require all
joint consumers to opt out before im-
plementing any opt-out direction.

(3) Alternative contents. If the con-
sumer is afforded a broader right to opt
out of receiving marketing than is re-
quired by this part, the requirements
of this section may be satisfied by pro-
viding the consumer with a clear, con-
spicuous, and concise notice that accu-
rately discloses the consumer’s opt-out
rights.

(4) Model notices. Model notices are
provided in Appendix C of Part 698 of
this chapter.

(b) Coordinated and consolidated no-
tices. A notice required by this part
may be coordinated and consolidated
with any other notice or disclosure re-
quired to be issued under any other
provision of law by the entity pro-
viding the notice, including but not
limited to the notice de-scribed in sec-
tion 603(d)(2)(A)Gii) of the Act and the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy no-
tice.

(c) Equivalent notices. A notice or
other disclosure that is equivalent to
the notice required by this part, and
that is provided to a consumer to-
gether with disclosures required by any
other provision of law, satisfies the re-
quirements of this section.

§ 680.24 Reasonable opportunity to opt
out.

(a) In general. You must not use eligi-
bility information about a consumer
that you receive from an affiliate to
make a solicitation to the consumer
about your products or services, unless
the consumer is provided a reasonable
opportunity to opt out, as required by

§680.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.

(b) Examples of a reasonable oppor-
tunity to opt out. The consumer is given
a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:

§ 680.24

(1) By mail. The opt-out notice is
mailed to the consumer. The consumer
is given 30 days from the date the no-
tice is mailed to elect to opt out by
any reasonable means.

(2) By electronic means. (i) The opt-out
notice is provided electronically to the
consumer, such as by posting the no-
tice at an Internet Web site at which
the consumer has obtained a product or
service. The consumer acknowledges
receipt of the electronic notice. The
consumer is given 30 days after the
date the consumer acknowledges re-
ceipt to elect to opt out by any reason-
able means.

(ii) The opt-out notice is provided to
the consumer by e-mail where the con-
sumer has agreed to receive disclosures
by e-mail from the person sending the
notice. The consumer is given 30 days
after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt
out by any reasonable means.

(3) At the time of an electronic trans-
action. The opt-out notice is provided
to the consumer at the time of an elec-
tronic transaction, such as a trans-
action conducted on an Internet Web
site. The consumer is required to de-
cide, as a necessary part of proceeding
with the transaction, whether to opt
out before completing the transaction.
There is a simple process that the con-
sumer may use to opt out at that time
using the same mechanism through
which the transaction is conducted.

(4) At the time of an in-person trans-
action. The opt-out notice is provided
to the consumer in writing at the time
of an in-person transaction. The con-
sumer is required to decide, as a nec-
essary part of proceeding with the
transaction, whether to opt out before
completing the transaction, and is not
permitted to complete the transaction
without making a choice. There is a
simple process that the consumer may
use during the course of the in-person
transaction to opt out, such as com-
pleting a form that requires consumers
to write a “yes” or “no” to indicate their
opt-out preference or that requires the
consumer to check one of two blank
check boxes—one that allows con-
sumers to indicate that they want to
opt out and one that allows consumers
to indicate that they do not want to
opt out.

615
§ 680.25

(5) By including in a privacy notice.
The opt-out notice is included in a
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy no-
tice. The consumer is allowed to exer-
cise the opt-out within a reasonable pe-
riod of time and in the same manner as
the opt-out under that privacy notice.

$680.25 Reasonable and simple meth-
ods of opting out.

(a) In general. You must not use eligi-
bility information about a consumer
that you receive from an affiliate to
make a solicitation to the consumer
about your products or services, unless
the consumer is provided a reasonable
and simple method to opt out, as re-
quired by §680.21(a)(1)Gi) of this part.

(b) Examples—(1) Reasonable and sim-
ple opt-out methods. Reasonable and
simple methods for exercising the opt-
out right include—

(i) Designating a check-off box in a
prominent position on the opt-out
form;

(ii) Including a reply form and a self-
addressed envelope together with the
opt-out notice;

(iii) Providing an electronic means to
opt out, such as a form that can be
electronically mailed or processed at
an Internet Web site, if the consumer
agrees to the electronic delivery of in-
formation;

(iv) Providing a toll-free telephone
number that consumers may call to opt
out; or

(v) Allowing consumers to exercise
all of their opt-out rights described in
a consolidated opt-out notice that in-
cludes the privacy opt-out under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801
et seq., the affiliate sharing opt-out
under the Act, and the affiliate mar-
keting opt-out under the Act, by a sin-
gle method, such as by calling a single
toll-free telephone number.

(2) Opt-out methods that are not rea-
sonable and simple. Reasonable and sim-
ple methods for exercising an opt-out
right do not include—

(i) Requiring the consumer to write
his or her own letter;

(ii) Requiring the consumer to call or
write to obtain a form for opting out,
rather than including the form with
the opt-out notice;

(iii) Requiring the consumer who re-
ceives the opt-out notice in electronic

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

form only, such as through posting at
an Internet Web site, to opt out solely
by paper mail or by visiting a different
Web site without providing a link to
that site.

(c) Specific opt-out means. Each con-
sumer may be required to opt out
through a specific means, as long as
that means is reasonable and simple
for that consumer.

§ 680.26 Delivery of opt-out notices.

(a) In general. The opt-out notice
must be provided so that each con-
sumer can reasonably be expected to
receive actual notice. For opt-out no-
tices provided electronically, the no-
tice may be provided in compliance
with either the electronic disclosure
provisions in this part or the provi-
sions in section 101 of the Electronic
Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.

(b) Examples of reasonable expectation
of actual notice. A consumer may rea-
sonably be expected to receive actual
notice if the affiliate providing the no-
tice:

(1) Hand-delivers a printed copy of
the notice to the consumer;

(2) Mails a printed copy of the notice
to the last known mailing address of
the consumer;

(3) Provides a notice by e-mail to a
consumer who has agreed to receive
electronic disclosures by e-mail from
the affiliate providing the notice; or

(4) Posts the notice on the Internet
Web site at which the consumer ob-
tained a product or service electroni-
cally and requires the consumer to ac-
knowledge receipt of the notice.

(c) Examples of no reasonable expecta-
tion of actual notice. A consumer may
not reasonably be expected to receive
actual notice if the affiliate providing
the notice:

(1) Only posts the notice on a sign in
a branch or office or generally pub-
lishes the notice in a newspaper;

(2) Sends the notice via e-mail to a
consumer who has not agreed to re-
ceive electronic disclosures by e-mail
from the affiliate providing the notice;
or

(3) Posts the notice on an Internet
Web site without requiring the con-
sumer to acknowledge receipt of the
notice.

$680.27 Renewal of opt-out.

(a) Renewal notice and opt-out require-
ment—(1) In general. After the opt-out
period expires, you may not make so-
licitations based on eligibility informa-
tion you receive from an affiliate to a
consumer who previously opted out,
unless:

(i) The consumer has been given a re-
newal notice that complies with the re-
quirements of this section and §§ 680.24
through 680.26 of this part, and a rea-
sonable opportunity and a reasonable
and simple method to renew the opt-
out, and the consumer does not renew
the opt-out; or

(ii) An exception in §680.21(c) of this
part applies.

(2) Renewal period. Each opt-out re-
newal must be effective for a period of
at least five years as provided in
§ 680.22(b) of this part.

(3) Affiliates who may provide the no-
tice. The notice required by this para-
graph must be provided:

(i) By the affiliate that provided the
previous opt-out notice, or its suc-
cessor; or

(ii) As part of a joint renewal notice
from two or more members of an affili-
ated group of companies, or their suc-
cessors, that jointly provided the pre-
vious opt-out notice.

(b) Contents of renewal notice. The re-
newal notice must be clear, con-
spicuous, and concise, and must accu-
rately disclose:

(1) The name of the affiliate(s) pro-
viding the notice. If the notice is pro-
vided jointly by multiple affiliates and
each affiliate shares a common name,
such as “ABC,” then the notice may in-
dicate that it is being provided by mul-
tiple companies with the ABC name or
multiple companies in the ABC group
or family of companies, for example, by
stating that the notice is provided by
“all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC
banking, credit card, insurance, and se-
curities companies,” or by listing the
name of each affiliate providing the no-
tice. But if the affiliates providing the
joint notice do not all share a common
name, then the notice must either sep-
arately identify each affiliate by name
or identify each of the common names
used by those affiliates, for example,
by stating that the notice is provided
by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies”

§ 680.27

or by “the ABC banking and credit card
companies and the XYZ insurance com-
panies;”

(2) A list of the affiliates or types of
affiliates whose use of eligibility infor-
mation is covered by the notice, which
may include companies that become af-
filiates after the notice is provided to
the consumer. If each affiliate covered
by the notice shares a common name,
such as “ABC,” then the notice may in-
dicate that it applies to multiple com-
panies with the ABC name or multiple
companies in the ABC group or family
of companies, for example, by stating
that the notice is provided by “all of
the ABC companies,” “the ABC bank-
ing, credit card, insurance, and securi-
ties companies,” or by listing the name
of each affiliate providing the notice.
But if the affiliates covered by the no-
tice do not all share a common name,
then the notice must either separately
identify each covered affiliate by name
or identify each of the common names
used by those affiliates, for example,
by stating that the notice applies to
“all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or
to “the ABC banking and credit card
companies and the XYZ insurance com-
panies;”

(3) A general description of the types
of eligibility information that may be
used to make solicitations to the con-
sumer;

(4) That the consumer previously
elected to limit the use of certain in-
formation to make solicitations to the
consumer;

(5) That the consumer’s election has
expired or is about to expire;

(6) That the consumer may elect to
renew the consumer’s previous elec-
tion;

(7) If applicable, that the consumer’s
election to renew will apply for the
specified period of time stated in the
notice and that the consumer will be
allowed to renew the election once that
period expires; and

(8) A reasonable and simple method
for the consumer to opt out.

(c) Timing of the renewal notice—(1) In
general. A renewal notice may be pro-
vided to the consumer either—

(i) A reasonable period of time before
the expiration of the opt-out period; or

617
§ 680.28

(ii) Any time after the expiration of
the opt-out period but before solicita-
tions that would have been prohibited
by the expired opt-out are made to the
consumer.

(2) Combination with annual privacy
notice. If you provide an annual privacy
notice under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq., providing a
renewal notice with the last annual
privacy notice provided to the con-
sumer before expiration of the opt-out
period is a reasonable period of time
before expiration of the opt-out in all
Cases.

(d) No effect on opt-out period. An opt-
out period may not be shortened by
sending a renewal notice to the con-
sumer before expiration of the opt-out
period, even if the consumer does not
renew the opt out.

date, and prospective application.

(a) Effective date. This part is effec-
tive January 1, 2008.

(b) Mandatory compliance date. Com-
pliance with this part is required not

a change of address for a consumer’s
debit or credit card account and, with-
in a short period of time afterwards
(during at least the first 30 days after
it receives such notification), the card
issuer receives a request for an addi-
tional or replacement card for the

APPENDIX A TO PART 681—INTERAGENCY
GUIDELINES ON IDENTITY THEFT DE-
TECTION, PREVENTION, AND MITIGA-
TION

Section 681.1 of this part requires each fi-
nancial institution and creditor that offers
or maintains one or more covered accounts,
as defined in §681.1(b)(8) of this part, to de-
velop and provide for the continued adminis-
tration of a written Program to detect, pre-
vent, and mitigate identity theft in connec-
tion with the opening of a covered account

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

or any existing covered account. These
guidelines are intended to assist financial in-
stitutions and creditors in the formulation
and maintenance of a Program that satisfies
the requirements of §681.1 of this part.

I. The Program

In designing its Program, a financial insti-
tution or creditor may incorporate, as appro-
priate, its existing policies, procedures, and
other arrangements that control reasonably
foreseeable risks to customers or to the safe-
ty and soundness of the financial institution
or creditor from identity theft.

II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags

(a) Risk Factors. A financial institution or
creditor should consider the following fac-
tors in identifying relevant Red Flags for
covered accounts, as appropriate:

(1) The types of covered accounts it offers
or maintains;

(2) The methods it provides to open its cov-
ered accounts;

(3) The methods it provides to access its
covered accounts; and

(4) Its previous experiences with identity
theft.

(b) Sources of Red Flags. Financial institu-
tions and creditors should incorporate rel-
evant Red Flags from sources such as:

(1) Incidents of identity theft that the fi-
nancial institution or creditor has experi-
enced;

(2) Methods of identity theft that the fi-
nancial institution or creditor has identified
that reflect changes in identity theft risks;
and

(3) Applicable supervisory guidance.

(c) Categories of Red Flags. The Program
should include relevant Red Flags from the
following categories, as appropriate. Exam-
ples of Red Flags from each of these cat-
egories are appended as supplement A to this
appendix A.

(1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings
received from consumer reporting agencies
or service providers, such as fraud detection
services;

(2) The presentation of suspicious docu-
ments;

(3) The presentation of suspicious personal
identifying information, such as a suspicious
address change;

(4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious
activity related to, a covered account; and

(5) Notice from customers, victims of iden-
tity theft, law enforcement authorities, or
other persons regarding possible identity
theft in connection with covered accounts
held by the financial institution or creditor.

III. Detecting Red Flags

The Program’s policies and procedures
should address the detection of Red Flags in

620
Federal Trade Commission

connection with the opening of covered ac-
counts and existing covered accounts, such
as by:

(a) Obtaining identifying information
about, and verifying the identity of, a person
opening a covered account, for example,
using the policies and procedures regarding
identification and verification set forth in
the Customer Identification Program rules
implementing 31 U.S.C. 53180) (1 CFR
103.121); and

(bo) Authenticating customers, monitoring
transactions, and verifying the validity of
change of address requests, in the case of ex-
isting covered accounts.

IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft

The Program’s policies and procedures
should provide for appropriate responses to
the Red Flags the financial institution or
creditor has detected that are commensurate
with the degree of risk posed. In determining
an appropriate response, a financial institu-
tion or creditor should consider aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of iden-
tity theft, such as a data security incident
that results in unauthorized access to a cus-
tomer’s account records held by the financial
institution, creditor, or third party, or no-
tice that a customer has provided informa-
tion related to a covered account held by the
financial institution or creditor to someone
fraudulently claiming to represent the finan-
cial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent
website. Appropriate responses may include
the following:

(a) Monitoring a covered account for evi-
dence of identity theft;

(b) Contacting the customer;

(c) Changing any passwords, security
codes, or other security devices that permit
access to a covered account;

(d) Reopening a covered account with a
new account number;

(e) Not opening a new covered account;

(f) Closing an existing covered account;

(g) Not attempting to collect on a covered
account or not selling a covered account to
a debt collector;

(h) Notifying law enforcement; or

(i) Determining that no response is war-
ranted under the particular circumstances.

V. Updating the Program

Financial institutions and creditors should
update the Program (including the Red Flags
determined to be relevant) periodically, to
reflect changes in risks to customers or to
the safety and soundness of the financial in-
stitution or creditor from identity theft,
based on factors such as:

(a) The experiences of the financial institu-
tion or creditor with identity theft;

(b) Changes in methods of identity theft;

(c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent,
and mitigate identity theft;

Pt. 681, App. A

(d) Changes in the types of accounts that
the financial institution or creditor offers or
maintains; and

(e) Changes in the business arrangements
of the financial institution or creditor, in-
cluding mergers, acquisitions, alliances,
joint ventures, and service provider arrange-
ments.

VI. Methods for Administering the Program

(a) Oversight of Program. Oversight by the
board of directors, an appropriate committee
of the board, or a designated employee at the
level of senior management should include:

(1) Assigning specific responsibility for the
Program’s implementation;

(2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff re-
garding compliance by the financial institu-
tion or creditor with §681.1 of this part; and

(3) Approving material changes to the Pro-
gram as necessary to address changing iden-
tity theft risks.

(b) Reports. (1) In general. Staff of the finan-
cial institution or creditor responsible for
development, implementation, and adminis-
tration of its Program should report to the
board of directors, an appropriate committee
of the board, or a designated employee at the
level of senior management, at least annu-
ally, on compliance by the financial institu-
tion or creditor with §681.1 of this part.

(2) Contents of report. The report should ad-
dress material matters related to the Pro-
gram and evaluate issues such as: The effec-
tiveness of the policies and procedures of the
financial institution or creditor in address-
ing the risk of identity theft in connection
with the opening of covered accounts and
with respect to existing covered accounts;
service provider arrangements; significant
incidents involving identity theft and man-
agement’s response; and recommendations
for material changes to the Program.

(c) Oversight of service provider arrange-
ments. Whenever a financial institution or
creditor engages a service provider to per-
form an activity in connection with one or
more covered accounts the financial institu-
tion or creditor should take steps to ensure
that the activity of the service provider is
conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect,
prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft. For example, a financial institution or
creditor could require the service provider
by contract to have policies and procedures
to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise
in the performance of the service provider’s
activities, and either report the Red Flags to
the financial institution or creditor, or to
take appropriate steps to prevent or miti-
gate identity theft.

621
Pt. 681, App. A

VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements

Financial institutions and creditors should
be mindful of other related legal require-
ments that may be applicable, such as:

(a) For financial institutions and creditors
that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5818(g), filing a
Suspicious Activity Report in accordance
with applicable law and regulation;

(b) Implementing any requirements under
15 U.S.C. 1681c-1ch) regarding the cir-
cumstances under which credit may be ex-
tended when the financial institution or
creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;

(c) Implementing any requirements for fur-
nishers of information to consumer reporting
agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example,
to correct or update inaccurate or incom-
plete information, and to not report informa-
tion that the furnisher has reasonable cause
to believe is inaccurate; and

(ad) Complying with the prohibitions in 15
U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and place-
ment for collection of certain debts resulting
from identity theft.

Supplement A to Appendix A

In addition to incorporating Red Flags
from the sources recommended in section
II.b. of the Guidelines in appendix A of this
part, each financial institution or creditor
may consider incorporating into its Pro-
gram, whether singly or in combination, Red
Flags from the following illustrative exam-
ples in connection with covered accounts:

Alerts, Notifications or Warnings from a
Consumer Reporting Agency

1. A fraud or active duty alert is included
with a consumer report.

2. A consumer reporting agency provides a
notice of credit freeze in response to a re-
quest for a consumer report.

3. A consumer reporting agency provides a
notice of address discrepancy, as defined in
§641.1(b) of this part.

4, A consumer report indicates a pattern of
activity that is inconsistent with the history
and usual pattern of activity of an applicant
or customer, such as:

a. A recent and significant increase in the
volume of inquiries;

b. An unusual number of recently estab-
lished credit relationships;

c. A material change in the use of credit,
especially with respect to recently estab-
lished credit relationships; or

d. An account that was closed for cause or
identified for abuse of account privileges by
a financial institution or creditor.

Suspicious Documents

5. Documents provided for identification
appear to have been altered or forged.

6. The photograph or physical description
on the identification is not consistent with

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

the appearance of the applicant or customer
presenting the identification.

7. Other information on the identification
is not consistent with information provided
by the person opening a new covered account
or customer presenting the identification.

8. Other information on the identification
is not consistent with readily accessible in-
formation that is on file with the financial
institution or creditor, such as a signature
card or a recent check.

9. An application appears to have been al-
tered or forged, or gives the appearance of
having been destroyed and reassembled.

Suspicious Personal Identifying Information

10. Personal identifying information pro-
vided is inconsistent when compared against
external information sources used by the fi-
nancial institution or creditor. For example:

a. The address does not match any address
in the consumer report; or

b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has
not been issued, or is listed on the Social Se-
curity Administration’s Death Master File.

11. Personal identifying information pro-
vided by the customer is not consistent with
other personal identifying information pro-
vided by the customer. For example, there is
a lack of correlation between the SSN range
and date of birth.

12. Personal identifying information pro-
vided is associated with known fraudulent
activity as indicated by internal or third-
party sources used by the financial institu-
tion or creditor. For example:

a. The address on an application is the
same as the address provided on a fraudulent
application; or

b. The phone number on an application is
the same as the number provided on a fraud-
ulent application.

13. Personal identifying information pro-
vided is of a type commonly associated with
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal
or third-party sources used by the financial
institution or creditor. For example:

a. The address on an application is ficti-
tious, a mail drop, or a prison; or

b. The phone number is invalid, or is asso-
ciated with a pager or answering service.

14. The SSN provided is the same as that
submitted by other persons opening an ac-
count or other customers.

15. The address or telephone number pro-
vided is the same as or similar to the address
or telephone number submitted by an unusu-
ally large number of other persons opening
accounts or by other customers.

16. The person opening the covered account
or the customer fails to provide all required
personal identifying information on an appli-
cation or in response to notification that the
application is incomplete.

622
Federal Trade Commission

17. Personal identifying information pro-
vided is not consistent with personal identi-
fying information that is on file with the fi-
nancial institution or creditor.

18. For financial institutions and creditors
that use challenge questions, the person
opening the covered account or the customer
cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be avail-
able from a wallet or consumer report.

Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related
to, the Covered Account

19. Shortly following the notice of a change
of address for a covered account, the institu-
tion or creditor receives a request for a new,
additional, or replacement card or a cell
phone, or for the addition of authorized users
on the account.

20. A new revolving credit account is used
in a manner commonly associated with
known patterns of fraud. For example:

a. The majority of available credit is used
for cash advances or merchandise that is eas-
ily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics
equipment or jewelry); or

b. The customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no
subsequent payments.

21. A covered account is used in a manner
that is not consistent with established pat-
terns of activity on the account. There is, for
example:

a. Nonpayment when there is no history of
late or missed payments;

b. A material increase in the use of avail-
able credit;

c. A material change in purchasing or
spending patterns;

d. A material change in electronic fund
transfer patterns in connection with a de-
posit account; or

e. A material change in telephone call pat-
terns in connection with a cellular phone ac-
count.

22. A covered account that has been inac-
tive for a reasonably lengthy period of time
is used (taking into consideration the type of
account, the expected pattern of usage and
other relevant factors).

23. Mail sent to the customer is returned
repeatedly as undeliverable although trans-
actions continue to be conducted in connec-
tion with the customer’s covered account.

24. The financial institution or creditor is
notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.

25. The financial institution or creditor is
notified of unauthorized charges or trans-
actions in connection with a customer’s cov-
ered account.

§ 682.2

Notice from Customers, Victims of Identity
Theft, Law Enforcement Authorities, or Other
Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in
Connection With Covered Accounts Held by
the Financial Institution or Creditor

26. The financial institution or creditor is
notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any
other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity
theft.

§ 682.1 Definitions.

(a) In general. Except as modified by
this part or unless the context other-
wise requires, the terms used in this
part have the same meaning as set
forth in the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.

(b) “Consumer information” means any
record about an individual, whether in
paper, electronic, or other form, that is
a consumer report or is derived from a
consumer report. Consumer informa-
tion also means a compilation of such
records. Consumer information does
not include information that does not
identify individuals, such as aggregate
information or blind data.

(c) “Dispose,” “disposing,” or “disposal”
means:

(1) The discarding or abandonment of
consumer information, or

(2) The sale, donation, or transfer of
any medium, including computer
equipment, upon which consumer infor-
mation is stored.

§682.2 Purpose and scope.

(a) Purpose. This part (“rule”) imple-
ments section 216 of the Fair and Accu-
rate Credit Transactions Act of 2008,

623
§ 682.3

which is designed to reduce the risk of
consumer fraud and related harms, in-
cluding identity theft, created by im-
proper disposal of consumer informa-
tion.

(b) Scope. This rule applies to any
person over which the Federal Trade
Commission has jurisdiction, that, for
a business purpose, maintains or other-
wise possesses consumer information.

§682.3 Proper disposal of consumer in-
formation.

(a) Standard. Any person who main-
tains or otherwise possesses consumer
information for a business purpose
must properly dispose of such informa-
tion by taking reasonable measures to
protect against unauthorized access to
or use of the information in connection
with its disposal.

(b) Examples. Reasonable measures to
protect against unauthorized access to
or use of consumer information in con-
nection with its disposal include the
following examples. These examples
are illustrative only and are not exclu-
sive or exhaustive methods for com-
plying with the rule in this part.

(1) Implementing and monitoring
compliance with policies and proce-
dures that require the burning, pulver-
izing, or shredding of papers containing
consumer information so that the in-
formation cannot practicably be read
or reconstructed.

(2) Implementing and monitoring
compliance with policies and proce-
dures that require the destruction or
erasure of electronic media containing
consumer information so that the in-
formation cannot practicably be read
or reconstructed.

(3) After due diligence, entering into
and monitoring compliance with a con-
tract with another party engaged in
the business of record destruction to
dispose of material, specifically identi-
fied as consumer information, in a
manner consistent with this rule. In
this context, due diligence could in-
clude reviewing an independent audit
of the disposal company’s operations
and/or its compliance with this rule,
obtaining information about the dis-
posal company from several references
or other reliable sources, requiring
that the disposal company be certified
by a recognized trade association or

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

similar third party, reviewing and eval-
uating the disposal company’s informa-
tion security policies or procedures, or
taking other appropriate measures to
determine the competency and integ-
rity of the potential disposal company.

(4) For persons or entities who main-
tain or otherwise possess consumer in-
formation through their provision of
services directly to a person subject to
this part, implementing and moni-
toring compliance with policies and
procedures that protect against unau-
thorized or unintentional disposal of
consumer information, and disposing of

APPENDIX B TO PART 698—MODEL FORMS
FOR RISK-BASED PRICING AND CRED-
IT SCORE DISCLOSURE EXCEPTION
NOTICES

1. This appendix contains two model forms
for risk-based pricing notices and three
model forms for use in connection with the
credit score disclosure exceptions. Each of
the model forms is designated for use in a
particular set of circumstances as indicated
by the title of that model form.

2. Model form B-1 is for use in complying
with the general risk-based pricing notice re-
quirements in §640.3. Model form B-2 is for
risk-based pricing notices given in connec-
tion with account review. Model form B-3 is
for use in connection with the credit score
disclosure exception for loans secured by res-
idential real property. Model form B—-4 is for
use in connection with the credit score dis-
closure exception for loans that are not se-
cured by residential real property. Model
form B- is for use in connection with the
credit score disclosure exception when no
credit score is available for a consumer. All
forms contained in this appendix are models;
their use is optional.

3. A person may change the forms by rear-
ranging the format or by making technical
modifications to the language of the forms,
in each case without modifying the sub-
stance of the disclosures. Any such rear-
rangement or modification of the language
of the model forms may not be so extensive
as to materially affect the substance, clar-
ity, comprehensibility, or meaningful se-
quence of the forms. Persons making revi-
sions with that effect will lose the benefit of
the safe harbor for appropriate use of Appen-
dix B model forms. A person is not required
to conduct consumer testing when rear-
ranging the format of the model forms.

a. Acceptable changes include, for exam-
ple:

ij. Corrections or updates to telephone
numbers, mailing addresses, or web site ad-
dresses that may change over time.

ii. The addition of graphics or icons, such
as the person’s corporate logo.

16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

jii. Alteration of the shading or color con-
tained in the model forms.

iv. Use of a different form of graphical
presentation to depict the distribution of
credit scores.

v. Substitution of the words “credit” and
“creditor” or “finance” and “finance company”
for the terms “loan” and “lender.”

vi. Including pre-printed lists of the
sources of consumer reports or consumer re-
porting agencies in a “check-the-box” format.

vii. Including the name of the consumer,
transaction identification numbers, a date,
and other information that will assist in
identifying the transaction to which the
form pertains.

viii. Including the name of an agent, such
as an auto dealer or other party, when pro-
viding the “Name of the Entity Providing the
Notice.”

b. Unacceptable changes include, for exam-
ple:

ij. Providing model forms on register re-
ceipts or interspersed with other disclosures.

ii. Eliminating empty lines and extra
spaces between sentences within the same
section.

4, If a person uses an appropriate Appendix
B model form, or modifies a form in accord-
ance with the above instructions, that per-
son shall be deemed to be acting in compli-
ance with the provisions of §640.4 or §640.5,
as applicable, of this regulation. It is in-
tended that appropriate use of Model Form
B-38 also will comply with the disclosure that
may be required under section 609(g) of the
FCRA.

B-1 Model form for risk-based pricing no-
tice.

B-2 Model form for account review risk-
based pricing notice.

B-8 Model form for credit score disclosure
exception for credit secured by one to four
units of residential real property.

B-4 Model form for credit score disclosure
exception for loans not secured by residen-
tial real property.

B-5 Model form for credit score disclosure
exception for loans where credit score is not
available.

Notice to the Home Loan Applicant

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a
consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key
factors affecting your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on
information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit
history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining
whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the
mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment
patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.

Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the
credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it 1s accurate. Credit records may vary from one
company to another.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the
consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if
the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to
take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan
application.

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.

Your Credit Score

Your credit score is not available from [Insert name of CRA], which is a consumer reporting

A credit score is a number that reflects the information in a credit report.

your bills on time and how much you owe to creditors.

A credit score can change, depending on how a consumer’s credit history changes.

APPENDIX C TO PART 698—MODEL FORMS
FOR AFFILIATE MARKETING OPT-OUT
NOTICES

A. Although use of the model forms is not
required, use of the model forms in this ap-
pendix (as applicable) complies with the re-
quirement in section 624 of the Act for clear,
conspicuous, and concise notices.

B. Certain changes may be made to the
language or format of the model forms with-
out losing the protection from liability af-
forded by use of the model forms. These
changes may not be so extensive as to affect
the substance, clarity, or meaningful se-
quence of the language in the model forms.
Persons making such extensive revisions will
lose the safe harbor that this appendix pro-
vides. Acceptable changes include, for exam-
ple:

1. Rearranging the order of the references
to “your income,” “your account history,”
and “your credit score.”

2. Substituting other types of information
for “income,” “account history,” or “credit
score” for accuracy, such as “payment his-
tory,” “credit history,” “payoff status,” or
“claims history.”

3. Substituting a clearer and more accu-
rate description of the affiliates providing or
covered by the notice for phrases such as
“the [ABC] group of companies,” including
without limitation a statement that the en-
tity providing the notice recently purchased
the consumer’s account.

4. Substituting other types of affiliates
covered by the notice for “credit card,” “in-
surance,” or “securities” affiliates.

5. Omitting items that are not accurate or
applicable. For example, if a person does not
limit the duration of the opt-out period, the
notice may omit information about the re-
newal notice.

6. Adding a statement informing con-
sumers how much time they have to opt out
before shared eligibility information may be
used to make solicitations to them.

7. Adding a statement that the consumer
may exercise the right to opt out at any
time.

8. Adding the following statement, if accu-
rate: “If you previously opted out, you do not
need to do so again.”

9. Providing a place on the form for the
consumer to fill in identifying information,
such as his or her name and address.

10. Adding disclosures regarding the treat-
ment of opt-outs by joint consumers to com-
ply with §680.23(a)(2) of part 680.

Response Center, Room 130-B, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C., 20580.

Remedying the Effects of Identity Theft

You are receiving this information because you have notified a consumer reporting
agency that you believe that you are a victim of identity theft. Identity theft occurs when
someone uses your name, Social Security number, date of birth, or other identifying information,
without authority, to commit fraud. For example, someone may have committed identity theft by
using your personal information to open a credit card account or get a loan in your name. For
more information, visit www.consumer.gov/idtheft or write to: FTC, Consumer Response
Center, Room 130-B, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C., 20580.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you specific nghts when you are, or believe
that you are, the victim of identity theft. Here is a brief summary of the rights designed to help
you recover from identity theft.

1. You have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting agencies place “fraud
alerts” in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of
identity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your
name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may
delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just
one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. As soon as that agency
processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud
alerts in your file.

° Equifax: 1-800-XXX-XXXX; www.equifax.com
° Experian: 1-800-XXX-XXXX; www.experian.com
e TransUnion: 1-800-XXX-XXXX; www.transunion.com

An initial fraud alert stays in your file for at least 90 days. An extended alert stays in your
file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will
require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social
Security number. If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity
theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a
federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer
reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about the
identity theft report, visit www.consumer.gov/idtheft.

2. You have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your “file
disclosure”). An initial fraud alert entitles you to a copy of all the information in your
file at each of the three nationwide agencies, and an extended alert entitles you to two free
file disclosures in a 12-month period following the placing of the alert. These additional
disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, whether fraudulent accounts
have been opened in your name or whether someone has reported a change in your
address. Once a year, you also have the right to a free copy of the information in your file

642
Federal Trade Commission

Pt. 698, App. F

at any consumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information due to
fraud, such as identity theft. You also have the ability to obtain additional free file
disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. See www.fic.gov/credit.

You have the right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transactions made or
accounts opened using your personal information. A creditor or other business must
give you copies of applications and other business records relating to transactions and
accounts that resulted from the theft of your identity, if you ask for them in writing. A
business may ask you for proof of your identity, a police report, and an affidavit before
giving you the documents. It also may specify an address for you to send your request.
Under certain circumstances, a business can refuse to provide you with these documents.

You have the right to obtain information from a debt collector. If you ask, a debt
collector must provide you with certain information about the debt you believe was
incurred in your name by an identity thief — like the name of the creditor and the amount

If you believe information in your file results from identity theft, you have the right
to ask that a consumer reporting agency block that information from your file. An
identity thief may run up bills in your name and not pay them. Information about the
unpaid bills may appear on your consumer report. Should you decide to ask a consumer
reporting agency to block the reporting of this information, you must identify the
information to block, and provide the consumer reporting agency with proof of your
identity and a copy of your identity theft report. The consumer reporting agency can
refuse or cancel your request for a block if, for example, you don’t provide the necessary
documentation, or where the block results from an error or a material misrepresentation
of fact made by you. If the agency declines or rescinds the block, it must notify you.
Once a debt resulting from identity theft has been blocked, a person or business with
notice of the block may not sell, transfer, or place the debt for collection.

See www.consumer.gov/idtheft.

of the debt.
5.
6.

You also may prevent businesses from reporting information about you to consumer
reporting agencies if you believe the information is a result of identity theft. To do
so, you must send your request to the address specified by the business that reports the
information to the consumer reporting agency. The business will expect you to identify
what information you do not want reported and to provide an identity theft report.

To learn more about identity theft and how to deal with its consequences, visit

www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or write to the FTC. You may have additional rights under state law.

For more information, contact your local consumer protection agency or your state attorney
general.

In addition to the new rights and procedures to help consumers deal with the effects of

identity theft, the FCRA has many other important consumer protections. They are described in
more detail at www.ftc. gov/credit.

A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act

The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of
information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting
agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about
check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major
rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go
to www.ftc.gov/credit or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade
Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.

° You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a
credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance,
or employment — or to take another adverse action against you — must tell you, and must give
you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.

° You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the
information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). You
will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security __
number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:

° a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit
report;

° you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file;

° your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;

° you are on public assistance;

° you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.

In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12
months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty
consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov/credit for additional information.

° You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your
credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score
from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real
property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive
credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.

° You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify
information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting
agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is fnvolous. See www.ftc.gov/credit
for an explanation of dispute procedures.

° Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or
unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be
removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may
continue to report information it has verified as accurate.

644
Federal Trade Commission Pt. 698, App. G

° Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most
cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven
years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.

Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about

you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor,
insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for
access.

You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer
reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential
employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not
required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov/credit.

You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information

in your credit report. Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include
a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the
lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-800-
XXX-XKXX.

You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a

user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates
the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.

° Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more
information, visit www.ftc.gov/credit.

States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In
some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state
or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. Federal enforcers are:

FURNISHER RESPONSIBILITIES nently displayed. Consumer reporting agen-
cies may limit the disclosure to only those
The prescribed form for this disclosure isa items that they know are relevant to the
separate document that is substantially  furnisher that will receive the notice.
Similar to the Commission’s model notice

640
Pt. 698, App. G 16 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

All furnishers subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s jurisdiction must comply with all applicable
regulations, including regulations promulgated after this notice was prescribed in 2004. Information
about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Commission’s Web site,
www.ftc.gov/credit. Furnishers who are not subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction should consult with
their regulators to find any relevant regulations.

NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION:
OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 1681-168ly, imposes
responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs).
These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. State law may
impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furmnishers of information to CRAs should
become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure
that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA 1s set forth in full at the Website of the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC): www.ftc.gov/credit. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-
referenced to the U.S. Code 1s at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the followmg duties upon furnishers:

Accuracy Guidelines

The banking and credit union regulators and the FTC will promulgate guidelines and
regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. The
regulations and guidelines issued by the FTC will be available at www.fic.gov/credit when they
are issued. Section 623(e).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information

The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that
they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not
subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which
consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections

623(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(C).
Duty to Correct and Update Information

If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes

information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or
accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In
addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and
must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623(a)(2).

646
Federal Trade Commission Pf. 698, App. G

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer

If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified for the furnisher for such
notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the
furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623(a)(1)(B).

If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or
accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report
that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623(a)(3).

The federal banking and credit union regulators and the FTC will issue regulations that
will identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the
furnisher by a consumer. Once these regulations are issued, furnishers must comply with them
and complete an investigation within 30 days (or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant
additional information) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a “credit repair
organization.” The FTC regulations will be available at www.ftc.gov/credit. Section 623(a)(8).

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency

If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of
information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The
furnisher must:
° Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the
CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections
623(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B).

° Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation
establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the
results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile

and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Section 623(b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D).

° Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the
dispute (or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information
to the CRA). Section 623(b)(2).

° Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section

623(b)(1 )(E).
Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts

If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the
ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs must report this fact
when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed.

Section 623(a)(4).
Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies

If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection,
charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after
reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement

647
Pt. 698, App. G 16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long
to keep the information in the consumer's file. Section 623(a)(5).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting
delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of
Section 623(a)(5) (until there is a consumer dispute) by reporting the same delinquency date
previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with
the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a
delinquency date cannot be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure
that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to
profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623(a)(5).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information

Financial institutions that furnish information to “nationwide” consumer reporting
agencies, as defined in Section 603(p), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or
have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623(a)(7). The Federal Reserve Board
has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 222, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information

A furnisher whose primary business 1s providing medical services, products, or devices
(and such furnisher’s agents or assignees) 1s a medical information furnisher for the purposes of
the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623(a)(9). This
notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604(g) when reporting
medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs

All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from
CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the
information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified
as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the
consumer that the information is correct. Section 623(a)(6). Ifa furnisher learns that it has
furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each consumer reporting
agency of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate
information. Section 623(a)(2). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher
may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances.
Section 615(f).

publications for businesses and the full text of the FCRA.

APPENDIX H TO PART 698—NOTICE OF
USER RESPONSIBILITIES

The prescribed form for this disclosure is a
separate document that is substantially
Similar to the Commission’s notice with all

information clearly and prominently dis-
played. Consumer reporting agencies may
limit the disclosure to only those items that
they Know are relevant to the user that will
receive the notice.

649
Pt. 698, App. H 16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

All users subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s jurisdiction must comply with all
applicable regulations, including regulations promulgated after this notice was

prescribed in 2004. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be
found at the Commission’s Web site, www.ftc.gov/credit. Persons not subject to the
Commission’s jurisdiction should consult with their regulators to find any relevant
regulations.

NOTICE TO USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS:
OBLIGATIONS OF USERS UNDER THE FCRA

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, requires that this notice be
provided to inform users of consumer reports of their legal obligations. State law may impose
additional requirements. The text of the FCRA is set forth in full at the Federal Trade
Commission's Website at www.ftc.gov/credit. At the end ofthis document is a list of United
States Code citations for the FCRA. Other information about user duties is also available at the
Commission’s Web site. Users must consult the relevant provisions of the FCRA for details
about their obligations under the FCRA.

The first section of this summary sets forth the responsibilities imposed by the FCRA on
all users of consumer reports. The subsequent sections discuss the duties of users of reports that
contain specific types of information, or that are used for certain purposes, and the legal
consequences of violations. If you are a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency
(CRA), you have additional obligations and will receive a separate notice from the CRA
describing your duties as a furnisher.

I. OBLIGATIONS OF ALL USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS

A. Users Must Have a Permissible Purpose

Congress has limited the use of consumer reports to protect consumers' privacy. All users
must have a permissible purpose under the FCRA to obtain a consumer report. Section 604
contains a list of the permissible purposes under the law. These are:

° As ordered by a court or a federal grand jury subpoena. Section 604(a)(1)

° As instructed by the consumer in writing. Section 604(a)(2)

° For the extension of credit as a result of an application from a consumer, or the
_ review or collection of a consumer's account. Section 604(a)(3)(A)

° For employment purposes, including hiring and promotion decisions, where the
consumer has given written permission. Sections 604(a)(3)(B) and 604(b)

600
Federal Trade Commission Pt. 698, App. H

° For the underwriting of insurance as a result of an application from a consumer.
Section 604(a)(3)(C)
° When there is a legitimate business need, in connection with a business

transaction that is initiated by the consumer. Section 604(a)(3)(F)(i)

° To review a consumer's account to determine whether the consumer continues to
meet the terms of the account. Section 604(a)(3)(F)(i1)
° To determine a consumer's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a

governmental instrumentality required by law to consider an applicant's financial

responsibility or status. Section 604(a)(3)(D) _

° For use by a potential investor or servicer, or current insurer, in a valuation or
assessment of the credit or prepayment risks associated with an existing credit

obligation. Section 604(a)(3)(E)

° For use by state and local officials in connection with the determination of child
support payments, or modifications and enforcement thereof. Sections 604(a)(4)

and 604(a)(5) ,

In addition, creditors and insurers may obtain certain consumer report information for the
purpose of making “prescreened” unsolicited offers of credit or insurance. Section 604(c). The
particular obligations of users of "prescreened" information are described in Section VII below.

B. Users Must Provide Certificati

Section 604(f) prohibits any person from obtaining a consumer report from a consumer
reporting agency (CRA) unless the person has certified to the CRA the permissible purpose(s) for
which the report is being obtained and certifies that the report will not be used for any other

purpose.

C. Users Must Notify Consumers When Adverse Actions Are Taken

The term "adverse action" is defined very broadly by Section 603. "Adverse actions"
include all business, credit, and employment actions affecting consumers that can be considered
to have a negative impact as defined by Section 603(k) of the FCRA — such as denying or
canceling credit or insurance, or denying employment or promotion. No adverse action occurs in
a credit transaction where the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the consumer.

651
Pt. 698, App. H 16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

1. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From a CRA

If a user takes any type of adverse action as defined by the FCRA that is based at least in
part on information contained in a consumer report, Section 615(a) requires the user to notify the
consumer. The notification may be done in writing, orally, or by electronic means. It must
include the following:

° The name, address, and telephone number of the CRA (including a toll-free
telephone number, if it is a nationwide CRA) that provided the report.

° A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse decision and is not able to
explain why the decision was made.

° A statement setting forth the consumer's right to obtain a free disclosure of the
consumer's file from the CRA if the consumer makes a request within 60 days.

° A statement setting forth the consumer's right to dispute directly with the CRA the
accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the CRA.

2. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Third Parties Who Are
Not Consumer Reporting Agencies

If a person denies (or increases the charge for) credit for personal, family, or household
purposes based either wholly or partly upon information from a person other than a CRA, and the
information is the type of consumer information covered by the FCRA, Section 615(b)(1)
requires that the user clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer his or her right to be told
the nature of the information that was relied upon if the consumer makes a written request within

60 days of notification. The user must provide the disclosure within a reasonable period of time
following the consumer's written request.

3. Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Affiliates

If a person takes an adverse action involving insurance, employment, or a credit
transaction initiated by the consumer, based on information of the type covered by the FCRA,
and this information was obtained from an entity affiliated with the user of the information by
common ownership or control, Section 615(b)(2) requires the user to notify the consumer of the
adverse action. The notice must inform the consumer that he or she may obtain a disclosure of
the nature of the information relied upon by making a written request within 60 days of receiving
the adverse action notice. If the consumer makes such a request, the user must disclose the
nature of the information not later than 30 days after receiving the request. If consumer report
information is shared among affiliates and then used for an adverse action, the user must make an
adverse action disclosure as set forth in I.C.1 above.

602
Federal Trade Commission Pt. 698, App. H

D. Users Have Obligations When Fraud and Active Duty Military Alerts are in
Files

When a consumer has placed a fraud alert, including one relating to identity theft, or an
active duty military alert with a nationwide consumer reporting agency as defined in Section
603(p) and resellers, Section 605A(h) imposes limitations on users of reports obtained from the
consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances, including the establishment of a new credit
plan and the issuance of additional credit cards. For initial fraud alerts and active duty alerts, the
user must have reasonable policies and procedures in place to form a belief that the user knows
the identity of the applicant or contact the consumer at a telephone number specified by the
consumer; in the case of extended fraud alerts, the user must contact the consumer in accordance
with the contact information provided in the consumer’s alert. ,

E. Users Have Obligations When Notified of an Address Discrepancy

Section 605(h) requires nationwide CRAs, as defined in Section 603(p), to notify users
that request reports when the address for a consumer provided by the user in requesting the report
is substantially different from the addresses in the consumer’s file. When this occurs, users must
comply with regulations specifying the procedures to be followed, which will be issued by the
Federal Trade Commission and the banking and credit union regulators. The Federal Trade
Commission’s regulations will be available at www.ftc. gov/credit.

F. Users Have Obligations When Disposing of Records

Section 628 requires that all users of consumer report information have in place
procedures to properly dispose of records containing this information. The Federal Trade
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the banking and credit union
regulators have issued regulations covering disposal. The Federal Trade Commission’s
regulations may be found at www.ftc. gov/credit.

II. CREDITORS MUST MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

If a person uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant,
extension, or provision of, credit to a consumer on material terms that are materially less
favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from
or through that person, based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the person must provide a
risk-based pricing notice to the consumer in accordance with regulations to be jointly prescribed
by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve Board.

Section 609(g) requires a disclosure by all persons that make or arrange loans secured by
residential real property (one to four units) and that use credit scores. These persons must

693
Pt. 698, App. H 16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

provide credit scores and other information about credit scores to applicants, including the
disclosure set forth in Section 609(g)(1)(D) (“Notice to the Home Loan Applicant”).

Ill. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS WHEN CONSUMER REPORTS ARE OBTAINED FOR
EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES

A. Employment Other Than in the Trucking Industry

If information from a CRA is used for employment purposes, the user has specific duties,
which are set forth in Section 604(b) of the FCRA. The user must:

° Make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the consumer before the report
is obtained, in a document that consists solely of the disclosure, that a consumer
report may be obtained.

° Obtain from the consumer prior written authorization. Authorization to access
reports during the term of employment may be obtained at the time of
employment.

° Certify to the CRA that the above steps have been followed, that the information
being obtained will not be used in violation of any federal or state equal
opportunity law or regulation, and that, if any adverse action 1s to be taken based
on the consumer report, a copy of the report and a summary of the consumer's
rights will be provided to the consumer.

° Before taking an adverse action, the user must provide a copy of the report to the
consumer as well as the summary of consumer’s rights. (The user should receive
this summary from the CRA.) A Section 615(a) adverse action notice should be
sent after the adverse action 1s taken.

An adverse action notice also is required in employment situations if credit information
(other than transactions and experience data) obtained from an affiliate 1s used to deny

employment. Section 615(b)(2)

The procedures for investigative consumer reports and employee misconduct
investigations are set forth below.

B. Employment in the Trucking Industry

Special rules apply for truck drivers where the only interaction between the consumer and
the potential employer is by mail, telephone, or computer. In this case, the consumer may
provide consent orally or electronically, and an adverse action may be made orally, in writing, or
electronically. The consumer may obtain a copy of any report relied upon by the trucking

604
Federal Trade Commission Pt. 698, App. H

company by contacting the company.
IV. OBLIGATIONS WHEN INVESTIGATIVE CONSUMER REPORTS ARE USED

Investigative consumer reports are a special type of consumer report in which information
about a consumer's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living is
obtained through personal interviews by an entity or person that is a consumer reporting agency.
Consumers who are the subjects of such reports are given special rights under the FCRA. Ifa
user intends to obtain an investigative consumer report, Section 606 requires the following:

° The user must disclose to the consumer that an investigative consumer report may
be obtained. This must be done in a written disclosure that is mailed, or otherwise
delivered, to the consumer at some time before or not later than three days after
the date on which the report was first requested. The disclosure must include a
statement informing the consumer of his or her right to request additional
disclosures of the nature and scope of the investigation as described below, and
the summary of consumer rights required by Section 609 of the FCRA. (The
summary of consumer rights will be provided by the CRA that conducts the
investigation.)

- ‘The user must certify to the CRA that the disclosures set forth above have been
made and that the user will make the disclosure described below.

° Upon the written request of a consumer made within a reasonable period of time
after the disclosures required above, the user must make a complete disclosure of
the nature and scope of the investigation. This must be made in a written
statement that is mailed, or otherwise delivered, to the consumer no later than five
days after the date on which the request was received from the consumer or the
report was first requested, whichever is later in time.

V. SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR EMPLOYEE INVESTIGATIONS

Section 603(x) provides special procedures for investigations of suspected misconduct by
an employee or for compliance with Federal, state or local laws and regulations or the rules of a
self-regulatory organization, and compliance with written policies of theemployer. These _
investigations are not treated as consumer reports so long as the employer or its agent complies
with the procedures set forth in Section 603(x), and a summary describing the nature and scope
of the inquiry is made to the employee if an adverse action is taken based on the investigation.

VI. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF MEDICAL INFORMATION

Section 604(g) limits the use of medical information obtained from consumer reporting
agencies (other than payment information that appears in a coded form that does not identify the

690
Pt. 698, App. H 16 CFR Ch. | (1-1-11 Edition)

medical provider). Ifthe information is to be used for an insurance transaction, the consumer
must give consent to the user of the report or the information must be coded. If the report is to be
used for employment purposes — or in connection with a credit transaction (except as provided in
regulations issued by the banking and credit union regulators) — the consumer must provide
specific written consent and the medical information must be relevant. Any user who receives
medical information shall not disclose the information to any other person (except where
necessary to carry out the purpose for which the information was disclosed, or as permitted by
statute, regulation, or order).

VII. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS OF "PRESCREENED" LISTS

The FCRA permits creditors and insurers to obtain limited consumer report information

for use in connection with unsolicited offers of credit or insurance under certain circumstances.

. This practice is known as "prescreening" and
typically involves obtaining from a CRA a list of consumers who meet certain preestablished
criteria. If any person intends to use prescreened lists, that person must (1) before the offer is
made, establish the criteria that will be relied upon to make the offer and to grant credit or
insurance, and (2) maintain such criteria on file for a three-year period beginning on the date on
which the offer is made to each consumer. In addition, any user must provide with each written
solicitation a clear and conspicuous statement that:

° Information contained in a consumer's CRA file was used in connection with the
transaction.

° The consumer received the offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for credit
worthiness or insurability used to screen for the offer.

° Credit or insurance may not be extended if, after the consumer responds, it is
determined that the consumer does not meet the criteria used for screening or any
applicable criteria bearing on credit worthiness or insurability, or the consumer
does not furnish required collateral.

° The consumer may prohibit the use of information in his or her file in connection
with future prescreened offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification
system established by the CRA that provided the report. The statement must
include the address and toll-free telephone number of the appropriate notification
system.

In addition, once the Federal Trade Commission by rule has established the format, type
size, and manner of the disclosure required by Section 615(d), users must be in compliance with
the rule. The FTC’s regulations will be at www.ftc.gov/credit.
