Federal reserve cities. The determination of said organization
committee shall not be subject to review except by the Federal
Reserve Board when organized: Provided, That the districts shall be

Under regulations to be prescribed by the organization committee,
every national banking association in the United States is hereby
required, and every eligible bank in the United States and every
trust company within the District of Columbia, is hereby authorized
to signify in writing, within sixty days after the passage of this Act,
its acceptance of the terms and provisions hereof. When the organi-
zation committee shall have designated the cities in which Federal
reserve banks are to be organized, and fixed the geographical limits
of the Federal reserve districts, every national banking association
within that district shall be required within thirty days after notice
from the organization committee, to subscribe to the capital stock
of such Federal reserve bank in a sum equal to six per centum
of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of such bank, one-sixth of
the subscription to be payable on call of the organization committee
or of the Federal Reserve Board, one-sixth within three months and
one-sixth within six months thereafter, and. the remainder of the sub-
scription, or any part thereof, shall be subject to call when deemed
necessary by the Federal Reserve Board, said payments to be in
gold or gold certificates.

The shareholders of every Federal reserve bank shall be held indi-
vidually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another,
for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such bank to the extent
of the amount of their subscriptions to such stock at the par value
thereof in addition to the amount subscribed, whether such subscrip-
tions have been paid up in whole or in part, under the provisions of
this Act.

Any national bank failing to signify its acceptance of the terms of
this Act within the sixty days aforesaid, shall cease to act as a reserve
agent, upon thirty days’ notice, to be given within the discretion of the
said organization committee or of the Federal Reserve Board.

Should any national banking association in the United States now
organized fail within one year after the passage of this Act to become
a member bank or fail to comply with any of the provisions of this
Act applicable thereto, all of the rights, privileges, and franchises of
such association granted to it under the national-bank Act, or under
the provisions of this Act, shall be thereby forfeited. Any noncom-
pliance with or violation of this Act shall, however, be determined
and adjudged by any court of the United States of competent juris-
diction in a suit brought for that purpose in the district or territory
in which such bank is located, under direction of the Federal Reserve
Board, by the Comptroller of the Currency in his own name before
the association shall be declared dissolved. In cases of such noncom-

liance or violation, other than the failure to become a member

ank under the provisions of this Act, every director who partici-
pated in or assented to the same shall be held liable in his personal
or individual capacity for all damages which said bank, its share-
holders, or any other person shall have sustained in consequence of
such violation. |

Such dissolution shall not take away or impair any remedy against
such corporation, its stockholders or officers, for any liability or
penalty which shall have been previously incurred.

' Should the subscriptions by banks to the stock of said Federal
reserve banks or any one or more of them be, in the judgment of the
organization committee, insufficient to provide the amount of capital

[Pup. 43.} 3

required therefor, then and in that event the said organization com-
mittee may, under conditions and regulations to be prescribed by it
offer to public subscription at par such an amount of stock in sai
Federal reserve banks, or any one or more of them, as said committee
shall determine, subject to the same conditions as to payment and
stock liability as provided for member banks.

No individual, copartnership, or corporation other than a member
bank of its district shall be permitted to subscribe for or to hold at
any time more than $25,000 par value of stock in any Federal reserve
bank. Such stock shall be known as public stock and may be trans-
ferred on the books of the Federal reserve bank by the chairman of
the board of directors of such bank.

Should the total subscriptions by banks and the public to the stock
of said Federal reserve banks, or any one or more of them, be, in the
judgment of the organization committee, insufficient to provide the
amount of capital required therefor, then and in that event the said
organization committee shall allot to the United States such an
amount of said stock as said committee shall determine. Said United
States stock shall be paid for at par out of any money in the Treas-
ury not otherwise appropriated, and. shall be held by the Secretary
of the Treasury and disposed of for the benefit of the United States
in such manner, at such times, and at such price, not less than par,
as the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine.

Stock not held by member banks shall not be entitled to voting

ower.
P The Federal Reserve Board is hereby empowered to adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations governing the transfers of said
stock.

No Federal reserve bank shall commence business with a sub-
scribed capital less than $4,000,000. The organization of reserve
districts and Federal reserve cities shall not be construed as chang-
ing the present status of reserve cities and central reserve cities,
except in so far as this Act changes the amount of reserves that
may be carried with approved reserve agents located therein. The
organization committee shall have power to appoint such assistants
and incur such expenses in carrying out the provisions of this Act as
it shail deem necessary, and such expenses shall be payable by the
Treasurer of the United States upon voucher approved 4 the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, and the sum of $100,000, or so much thereof as
may be necessary, is hereby appropriated, out of any moneys in the
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the payment of such
expenses.

BRANCH OFFICES.

Src. 3. Each Federal reserve bank shall establish branch banks
within the F cderal reserve district in which it is located and may do
so in the district of any Federal reserve bank which may bave been
suspended. Such branches shall be operated by a board of directors
under rules and regulations approved by the Federal Reserve Board.
Directors of branch banks shall possess the same qualifications as
directors of the Federal reserve banks. Four of said directors shall
be selected by the reserve bank and three by the Federal Reserve
Board, and they shall hold office during the pleasure, respectively,
of the parent bank and the Federal Reserve Board. The reserve
bank shall designate one of the directors as manager.

STOCK ISSUES; INCREASE AND DECREASE OF CAPITAL.

Sec. 5. The capital stock of each Federal reserve bank shall be
divided into shares of $100 each. The outstanding capital stock
shall be increased from time to time as member banks increase their
capital stock and surplus or as additional banks become members,
and may be decreased as member banks reduce their capita! stock or
surplus or cease to be members. Shares of the capital stock of
Federal reserve banks owned by member banks shall not be trans-
ferred or hypothecated. When a member bank increases its capi-
tal stock or surplus, it shall thereupon subscribe for an additional
amount of capital stock of the Federal reserve bank of its district
equal to six per centum of the said increase, one-half of said sub-
8 [Pup. 43.)

serlption to be paid in the manner hereinbefore provided for original
subscription, and one-half subject to call of the Federal Reserve
Board. A bank applying for stock in a Federal reserve bank at any
time after the organization thereof must subseribe for an amount of
the capital stock of the Federa) reserve bank equal to six per centum
of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of said applicant bank, pay-
ing therefor its par value plus one-half of one per centum a month
from the period of the last dividend. When the capital stock of any
Federal reserve bank shall have been increased either on account of
the increase of capital stock of member banks or on account of the
increase in the number of member banks, the board of directors shall
cause to be executed a certificate to the Comptroller of the Currency
showing the increase in capital stock, the amount paid in, and b
whom paid. When a member bank reduces its capital stock it sha
surrender a proportionate amount of its holdings in the capital of
said Federal reserve bank, and when a member bank voluntarily
liquidates it shall surrender all of its holdings of the capital
stock of said Federal reserve bank and be released from its stock
subscription not previously called. In either case the shares sur-
rendered shall be canceled and the member bank shall receive in

ayment therefor, uncer regulations to be prescribed by the Federal

eserve Board, a sum equal to its cash-paid subscriptions on the
shares surrendered and one-half of one per centum a month from the
period of the last dividend, not to exceed the book value thereof, less
any hability of such member bank to the Federal reserve bank.

go. 6. If any member bank shall be declared insolvent and a
receiver appointed therefor, the stock held by it in said Federal
reserve bank shall be canceled, without impairment of its liability,
and all cash-paid subscriptions on said stock, with one-half of one per
centum per month from the period of last dividend, not to exceed
the book value thereof, shall be first applied to all debts of the insol-
vent member bank to the Federal reserve bank, and the balance, if
any, shall be paid to the receiver of the insolvent bank. Whenever
the capital stock of a Federal reserve bank is reduced, either on
account of a reduction in capital stock of any member bank or of the
liquidation or insolvency of such bank, the board of directors shall
cause to be executed a, certificate to the Comptroller of the Currency
showing such reduction of capital stock and the amount repaid to
such bank.
DIVISION OF EARNINGS.

Seo. 7, After all necessary expenses of a Federal reserve bank
have been paid or provided for, the stockholders shall be entitled to
receive an annual dividend of six per centum on the paid-in capital
stock, which dividend shall be cumulative. After the aforesaid
dividend claims have been fully met, all the net earnings shail be
paid to the United States as a franchise tax, except that one-half of
such net earnings shall be paid into a surplus fund until it shall
amount to forty per centum of the paid-in capital stock of such
bank.

The net earnings derived by the United States from Federal reserve
banks shall, in the discretion of the Secretary, be used to supplement
the gold reserve held against outstanding United States notes, or shall
be applied to the reduction of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of

{Pus. 43] 9

the United States under regulations to be prescribed by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury. Should a Federal reserve bank be dissolved
or go into liquidation, any surplus remaining, after the payment of all
debts, dividend requirements as hereinbefore provided, and the par
value of the stock, shall be paid to and become the property of the
United States and shall be similarly applied.

Federal reserve banks, including the capital stock and surplus
therein, and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from
Federal, State, and local taxation, except taxes upon real estate.

Sec. 8. Section fifty-one hundred and fifty-four, United States
Revised Statutes, is hereby amended to read as follows:

Any bank incorporated by special law of any State or of the
United States or organized under the general laws of any State or of
the United States and having an unimpaired capital sufficient to
entitle it to become a national banking association under the pro-
visions of the existing laws may, by the vote of the shareholders
owning not less than fifty-one per centum of the capital stock of
such bank or banking association, with the approval of the Comp-
troller of the Currency be converted into a national banking associ-
ation, with any name approved by the Comptroller of the Currency:

Provided, however, That said conversion shail not bein contravention
of the State law. In such case the articles of association and organi-
zation certificate may be executed by a majority of the directors of
the bank or banking institution, and the certificate shail declare that
the owners of fifty-one per centum of the capital stock have author-
ized the directors to make such certificate and to change or convert
the bank or banking institution into a national association. A ma-
jority of the directors, after executing the articles of association and
the organization certificate, shall have power to execute all other
papers and to do whatever may be required to make its organization
perfect and complete as a national association. The shares of any
such bank may continue to be for the same amount each as they
were before the conversion, and the directors may continue to be
directors of the association until others are elected or appointed in
accordance with the provisions of the statutes of the United States.
When the Comptroller has given to such bank or banking association
a certificate that the provisions of this Act have been complied with,
such bank or banking association, and all its stockholders, officers
and employces, shall have the same powers and privileges, and shall
be subject to the same duties, liabilities, and regulations, in all re-
spects, as shall have been prescribed by the Federal Reserve Act and
by the national banking Act for associations originally organized as
national banking associations.

STATE BANKS AS MEMBERS.

States, may make application to the reserve bank organization
committee, pending organization, and thereafter to the Federal
Reserve Board for the right to subscribe to the stock of the Federal
reserve bank organized or to be organized within the Federal reserve
district where the applicant is located. The organization committee
or the Federal Reserve Board, under such rules and regulations as

10 [Pun. 43.}

shall permit the applving bank to become a stockholder in the Federal
reserve bank of the district, stock shall be issued and paid for under
the rules and regulations in this Act provided for national banks
which become stockholders in Federal reserve banks.

The organization committee or the Federal Reserve Board shall
establish by-laws for the general government of its conduct in acting
upon applications made by the State banks and banking associations
and trust companies for stock ownership in Federal reserve banks.
Such by-laws shall require applymg banks not organized under
Federal law to comply with the reserve and capital requirements
and to submit to the examination and regulations prescribed by the
organization committee or by the Federal Reserve Board. No ap-
plying bank shall be admitted to membership in a Federal reserve

ank unless it possesses a paid-up unimpaired capital sufficient to
entitle it to become a national banking association in the place where
it is situated, under the provisions of the national banking Act.

Any bank becoming a member of a Federal reserve bank under the
provisions of this section shall, in addition to the regulations and
restrictions hereinbefore provided, be required to conform to the
provisions of law imposed on the national banks respecting the

sections fifty-two hundred and eleven and fifty-two hundred and
swelve of the Revised Statutes, and shall be subject to the penalties
prescribed by section fifty-two hundred and thirteen for the failure
to make such report.

If at any time it shall appear to the Federal Reserve Board that a
member bank has failed to comply with the provisions of this section
or the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, it shall be within the
power of the said board, after hearing, to require such bank to sur-
render its stock in the Federal reserve bank; upon such surrender the
Federal reserve bank shall pay the cash-paid subscriptions to the said
stock with interest at the rate of one-half of one per centum per
month, computed from the last dividend, if earned, not to exceed

POWERS OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANES.

Sec. 13. Any Federal reserve bank may receive from any of its
member banks, and from the United States, deposits of current funds
in lawful money, national-bank notes, Federal reserve notes, or
checks and drafts upon solvent member banks, payable upon presen-
tation; or, solely for exchange purposes, may receive from other
Federal reserve banks deposits of current funds in lawful money,
national-bank notes, or checks and drafts upon solvent member or
other Federal reserve banks, payable upon presentation.

Upon the indorsement of any of its member banks, with a waiver of
demand, notice and protest. by such bank, any Federal reserve bank
may discount notes, drafts, and bills of exchange arising out of actual
commercial transactions; that is, notes, drafts, and bills of exchange
issued or drawn for agricultural, industrial, or commercial purposes,
or the proceeds of which have been used, or are to be used, for such
purposes, the Federal Reserve Board to have the right to determine
or define the character of the paper thus eligible for discount, withm
the meaning of this Act. Nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to prohibit such notes, drafts, and bills of exchange, secured
by staple agricultural products, or other goods, wares, or merchandise
(Pun, 43.} 15

from being eligible for such discount; but such definition shall not
include notes, drafts, or bills covering merely investments or issued
or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading in stocks, bonds, or
other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the Govern-
ment of the United States. Notes, drafts, and bills admitted to dis-
count under the terms of this paragraph must have a maturity at
the time of discount of not more than ninety days: Provided, That
notes, drafts, and bills drawn or issued for agricultural purposes or
based on live stock and having a maturity not exceeding six months
may be discounted in an amount to be limited to a percentage of the
capital of the Federal reserve bank, to be ascertained and fixed by the
Federal Reserve Board.

Any Federal reserve bank may discount acceptances which are
based on the importation or exportation of goods and which have
a maturity at time of discount of not more than three months, and
indorsed by at least one member bank. The amount of acceptances
so discounted shall at no time exceed one-half the paid-up capital stock
and surplus of the bank for which the rediscounts are made.

The aggregate of such notes and bills bearing the signature or in-
dorsement of any one person, company, firm, or corporation redis-
counted for any one bank shall at no time exceed ten per centum of the
unimpaired capital and surplus of said bank; but this restriction shall
not apply to the discount of bills of exchange drawn in good faith
against actually existing values.

Any member bank may accept drafts or bills of exchange drawn
upon it and growing out of transactions involving the importation
or exportation of goods having not more than six months sight to
run; but no bank shall accept such bills to an amount equal at an
time in the aggregate to more than one-half its paid-up capital stoc
and surplus.

Section fifty-two hundred and two of the Revised Statutes of the
United States is hereby amended so as to read as follows: No national
banking association shall at any time be indebted, or in any wa
liable, to an amount exceeding the amount of ite capital stock at suc.
time actually paid in and remaining undiminished by losses or other-
wise, except on account of demands of the nature following:

First. Notes of circulation.

Second. Moneys deposited with or collected by the association.

Third. Bills of exchange or drafts drawn against money actually
on deposit to the credit of the association, or due thereto.

Fourth. Liabilities to the stockholders of the association for
dividends and reserve profits.

Fifth. Liabilities incurred under the provisions of the Federal
Reserve Act.

tions,, and regulations as may be imposed by the Federal Reserve

oard.

by this Act made eligible for rediscount, with or without the indorse-
ment of a member bank.
Every Federal reserve bank shall have power:

any part thereof may be deposited in such banks, and disbursements
may be made by checks drawn against such deposits.

o public funds of the Philippine Islands, or of the postal savings,
or any Government funds, shall be deposited in the continental United
States in any bank not belonging to the system established by this Act:

NOTE ISSUES.

Sec. 16. Federal reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the
Federal Reserve Board for the purpose of making advances to Federal
reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set
forth and for no other purpose, are hereby authorized. The said notes
shall be obligations of the United States and shall be receivable by all
national and member banks and Federal reserve banks and for all
taxes, customs, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in
gold on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in
the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or in gold or lawful
money at any Federal reserve bank.

Any Federal reserve bank may make application to the local
Federal reserve agent for such amount of the Federal reserve notes
hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application shall
be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal reserve agent of
collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal reserve notes thus
applied for and issued pursuant to such application. The collateral
security thus offered shall be notes and bills, accepted for rediscount
under the provisions of section thirteen of this Act, and the Federal
reserve agent shall each day notify the Federal Reserve Board of all
issues and withdrawals of Federal reserve notes to and by the Federal
reserve bank to which he is accredited. The said Federal Reserve
Board may at any time call upon a Federal reserve bank for addi-
tional security to protect the Federal reserve notes issued to it.

Every Federal reserve bank shall maintain reserves in gold or
Jawful money of not less than thirty-five per centum against its
deposits and reserves in gold of not less than forty per centum
against its Federal reserve notes in actual circulation, and not
offset by gold or lawful money deposited with the Federal re-
serve agent. Notes so paid out shall bear upon their faces a
distinctive letter and serial number, which shall be assigned
by the Federal Reserve Board to each Federal reserve bank. en-
ever Federal reserve notes issued through one Federal reserve bank
shall be received by another Federal reserve bank they shall be

romptly returned for credit or redemption to the Federal reserve
fank through which they were originally issued. No Federal reserve
bank shall pay out notes issued through another under penalty of a
tax of ten per centum upon the face value of notes so paid out. Notes
presented for redemption at the Treasury of the United States shall

e paid out of the redemption fund and returned to the Federal
reserve banks through which they were originally issued, and there-
upon such Federal reserve bank shall, upon demand of the Secretary
of the Treasury, reimburse such redemption fund in lawful money
or, if such Federal reserve notes have been redeemed by the Treasurer
gold or gold certificates, then such funds shall be reimbursed to
the extent deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury in gold
or gold certificates, and such Federal reserve bank shall, so long as
any of its Federal reserve notes remain outstanding, maintain with
the Treasurer in gold an amount sufficient in the gud ment of the
Secretary to provide for all redemptions to be made by the Treasurer.
Federal reserve notes received by the Treasury, otherwise than for
redemption, may be exchanged for gold out of the redemption fund

they were originally issued, or they may be returned to such bank
for the credit of the United States. Federal ressrve notes unfit for
circulation shall be returned by the Federal reserve agents to the
Comptroller of the Currency for cancellation and destruction.

The Federal Reserve Board shall require each Federal reserve bank
to maintain on deposit in the Treasury of the United States a sum
in gold sufficient in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury
for the redemption of the Federal reserve notes issued to suc
bank, but in no event less than five Pe centum; but such de-
posit of gold shall be counted and included as part of the forty per
centum reserve hereinbefore required. The board shall have the
right, acting through the Federal reserve agent, to grant in whole
or in part or to reject entirely the application of any Federal
reserve bank for Federal reserve notes; but to the extent that such
application may be granted the Federal Reserve Board shall, through
its local Federal reserve agent, supply Federal reserve notes to the
bank so applying, and such bank shall be charged with the amount
of such notes and shall pay such rate of interest on said amount as
may be established by the Federal Reserve Board, and the amount of
such Federal reserve notes so issued to any such bank shall, upon
delivery, together with such notes of such Federal reserve bank as
may be issued under section eighteen of this Act upon security of
United States two per centum Government bonds, become a first and
paramount lien on all the assets of such bank.

Any Federal reserve bank may at any time reduce its liability for
outstanding Federal reserve notes by depositing, with the Federal
reserve agent, its Federal reserve notes, gold, gold certificates, or
Jawful money of the United States. Federal reserve notes so depos-
ited shall not be reissued, except upon compliance with the conditions
of an original issue.

The Federal reserve agent shall hold such gold, gold certificates, or
lawful money available exclusively for exchange for the outstandin
Federal reserve notes when offered by the reserve bank of which heis
a director. Upon the request of the Secretary of the Treasury the
Federal Reserve Board shall require the Federal reserve agent to
transmit so much of said gold to the Treasury of the United States as
may be required for the exclusive purpose of the redemption of such
notes.

Any Federal reserve bank may at its discretion withdraw collateral
deposited with the local Federal reserve agent for the protection of
its Federal reserve notes deposited with it.and shall at-the same time
substitute therefor other like collateral of equal amount with the
approval of the Federal reserve agent under regulations to be pre-
scribed by the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to furnish suitable notes for circulation as Federal reserve
notes, the Comptroller of the Currency shall, under the direction of
the Secretary of the Treasury, cause plates and dies to be engraved
in the best manner to guard against counterfeits and fraudulent
alterations, and shall have printed therefrom and numbered such

uantities of such notes of the denominations of $5, $10, $20,
50, $100, as may be required to supply the Federal reserve banks.
Such notes shall be in form and tenor as directed by the Secretary of
the Treasury under the provisions of this Act and shaJl bear the

tPop. 43.] 19

distinetive numbers of the several Federal reserve banks through
which they are issued.

When such notes have been prepared, they shall be deposited in
the Treasury, or in the subtreasury or mint of the United States
nearest the place of business of each Federal reserve bank and shall
be held for the use of such bank subject to the order of the Comp-
troller of the Currency for their delivery, as provided by this Act.

The plates and dies to be procured by the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency for the printing of such circulating notes shall remain under
his control and direction, and the expenses necessarily incurred in
executing the laws relating to the procuring of such notes, and all
other expenses incidental to their issue and retirement, shall be paid
by the Federal reserve banks, and the Federal Reserve Board shall
include in its astimate of expenses levied against the Federal reserve
banks a suffic.ent amount to cover the expenses herem provided for.

The examination of plates, dies, bed pieces, and so forth, and
regulations relating to such examination of plates, dies, and so forth,
of national-bank notes provided for in section fifty-one hundred and
seventy-four Revised Statutes, is hereby extended to imelude notes
herein provided for.

the Treasury for engraving plates and dies, the purchase of distinc-
tive paper, or to cover any other expense in connection with the
printing of national-bank notes or notes provided for by the Act of

ay thirtieth, nineteen hundred and eight, and any distinctive paper
that may be on hand at the time of the passage of this Act may be
used in the discretion of the Secretary for the purposes of this Act,
and should the appropriations heretofore made be msufficient to
meet the requirements of this Act in addition to circulatmg notes
provided for by existing law, the Secretary is hereby authorized to
use so much of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated
for the purpose of furnishing the notes aforesaid: Provided, however,
That nothing in this section contained shal! be construed as exempt-
ing national banks or Federal reserve banks from their lability *.
reimbruse the United States for any expenses incurred in pe. ane
and issuing circulating notes.

Every Federal reserve bank shall receive on deposit at par from
member banks or from Federal reserve banks checks and draits drawn
upon any of its depositors, and when remitted by a Federal reserve
bank, checks and drafts drawn by any depositor in any other Federal
reserve bank or member bank upon funds to the credit of said deposi-
tor in said reserve bank or member bank. Nothing herein contained
shall be construed as prohibiting a member bank from charging its
actual expense incurred in collecting and remitting funds, or for
exchange sold to its patrons. The Federal Reserve Board shall, by
rule, fix the charges to be collected by the member banks from its
patrons whose checks are cleared through the Federal reserve bank
and the charge which may be imposed for the service of clearmg or
collection rendered by the Federal reserve bank.

The Federal Reserve Board sha}! make and promulgate from time
to time regulations governing the transfer of funds and charges
therefor among Federal reserve banks and their branches, and may
at its discretion exercise the functions of a clearing house for such
Federal reserve banks, or may designate a Federal reserve bank to

20366 O-—58—— 25

20 (Pop. 43.)

exercise such functions, and may also require each such bank to
exercise the functions of a clearing house for its member banks.

statutes as require that before any national banking associations
shall be authorized to commence banking business it shall transfer
and deliver to the Treasurer of the United States a stated amount of
United States registered bonds is hereby repealed.

REFUNDING BONDS.

Sro. 18. After two years from the passage of this Act, and at an
time during a period of twenty years thereafter, any member b
desiring to retire the whole or any part of its circulating notes, may
file with the Treasurer of the United States an application to sell for
its account, at par and accrued interest, United States bonds secur-
ing circulation to be retired.

e Treasurer shall, at the end of each quarterly period, furnish
the Federal Reserve Board with a list of such applications, and the
Federal Reserve Board may, in its discretion, require the Federal
reserve banks to purchase such bonds from the banks whose appli-
cations have been filed with the Treasurer at least ten days before
the end of any quarterly period at which the Federal Reserve Board
may direct the purchase to be made: Provided, That Federal reserve
banks shall not be permitted to purchase an amount to exceed
$25,000,000 of such bonds in any one year, and which amount shall
include bonds acquired under section four of this Act by the Federal
reserve bank.

Provided further, That the Federal Reserve Board shall allot to
each Federal reserve bank such proportion of such bonds as the
capital and surplus of such bank shall bear to the aggregate capital
and surplus of all the Federal reserve banks.

Upon notice from the Treasurer of the amount of bonds so sold for
its account, each member bank shall duly assign and transfer, in
writing, such bonds to the Federal reserve bank purchasing the
same, and such Federal reserve bank shail, thereupon, deposit lawful
money with the Treasurer of the United States for the purchase price
of such bonds, and the Treasurer shall ay to the member bank selling
such bonds any balance due after i ucting a sufficient sum to
redeem its outstanding notes secured by such bonds, which notes
shall be canceled and permanently retired when redeemed.

The Federal reserve banks purchasing such bonds shall be per-
mitted to take out an amount of circulating notes equal to the par
value of such bonds.

Upon the deposit with the Treasurer of the United States of bonds
sO purchased, or any bonds with the circulating privilege acquired
under section four of this Act, any Federal reserve bank ma ing
such deposit in the manner provided by existing law, shall be entit!
to receive from the Comptroller of the Currency circulating notes
in blank, registered and countersigned as provided by law, equal in
amount to the par value of the bonds so deposited. Such notes

(Pus. 43.] 21

shall be the obligations of the Federal reserve bank procuring the
same, and shall be in form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treas.
ury, and to the same tenor and effect as national-bank notes now
provided by law. They shall be issued and redeemed under the
same terms and conditions as national-bank notes except that they
shall not be limited to the amount of the capital stock of the Federal
reserve bank issuing them.

Upon application of any Federal reserve bank, approved by the
Federal Reserve Board, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue, in
exchange for United States two per centum gold bonds bearing the cir-
culation privilege, but against which no circulation is outstanding,
one-year gold notes of the United States without the circulation
privilege, to an amount not to exceed one-half of the two per centum

onds so tendered for exchange, and thirty-year three per centum
gold bonds without the circulation privile e for the remainder of the
two per centum bonds so tendered: Provided, That at the time of such
exchange the Federal reserve bank obtaining such one-year gold
notes shall enter into an obligation with the Secretary of the Treas-
ury binding itself to purchase from the United States for gold at the
maturity of such one-year notes, an amount equal to those delivered
in exchange for such bonds, if so requested by the Secretary, and at
each maturity of one-year notes so purchased by such Federal reserve
bank, to purchase from the United States such an amount of one-year
notes as the Secretary may tender to such bank, not to exceed the
amount issued to such bank in the first instance, in exchange for the
two per centum United States gold bonds; said obligation to pur-
chase at maturity such notes shall continue in force for a period not
to exceed thirty years.

For the purpose of making the exchange herein provided for, the
Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue at par Treasury notes
in coupon or registered form as he may prescribe in denominations
of one hundred dollars, or any multiple thereof, bearing interest at
the rate of three per centum per annum, payable quarterly, such
Treasury notes to be payable not more than one year from the date of
their issue in gold coin of the present standard value, and to be exempt
as to principal and interest from the payment of all taxes and duties
of the United States except as rovide by this Act, as well as from
taxes in any form by or under State, municipal, or local authorities.
And for the same purpose, the Secretary is authorized and empowered
to issue United States gold bonds at par, bearing three per centum
interest payable thirty years from date of issue, such bonds to be of
the same general tenor and effect and to be issued under the same
goneral terms and conditions as the United States three per centum

onds without the circulation privilege now issued and outstanding.

Upon application of any Federal reserve bank, approved by the
Federal Reserve Board, the Secretary may issue at par such three
per centum bonds in exchange for the one-year gold notes herein
provided for.

bank in any district, every subscribing member bank shall establish
and maintain reserves as follows:

In the Federal reserve bank of its district, for a period of twelve
months after said date, two-twelfths, and for each succeeding six
months an additional one-twelfth, until five-twelfths have been so

for a period of thirty-six months after said date the balance of
the reserves may be held in its own vaults, or in the Federal reserve
bank, or in national banks in reserve or central reserve cities as now
defined by law.

After said thirty-six months’ period said reserves, other than
those hereinbefore required to be held in the vaults of the member
bank and in the Federal reserve bank, shall be held in the vaults of
the member bank or in the Federal reserve bank, or in both, at the
option of the member bank.

(b) A bank in a reserve city, as now or hereafter defined, shall hold
and maintain reserves equal to fifteen per centum of the aggregate
amount of its demand deposits and five per centum of its time
deposits, as follows:

n its vaults for a period of thirty-six months after said date
six-fifteenths thereof, and permanently thereafter five-fifteenths.

In the Federal reserve bank of its district for a period of twelve
months after the date aforesaid at least three-fifteenths, and for each
succeeding six months an additional one-fifteenth, until six-fifteenths
have been so deposited, which shall be the amount permanently
required.

or a period of thirty-six months after said date the balance of
the reserves may be held in its own vaults, or im the Federal reserve
bank, or in national banks in reserve or central reserve cities as now
defined by law.

After said thirty-six months’ period all of said reserves, except
those hereinbefore required to be held permanently in the vaults of
the member bank and in the Federal reserve bank, shall be held in
its vaults or in the Federal reserve bank, or in both, at the option
of the member bank.

(c) A bank in a central reserve city, as now or hereafter defined,
shall hold and maintain a reserve equal to eighteen per centum of
the aggregate amount of its demand deposits and five per centum of
its time deposits, as follows:

In its vaults six-eighteenths thereof.

In the Federal reserve bank seven-eighteenths.

The balance of said reserves shall be held in its own vaults or im
the Federal reserve bank, at its option.

Any Federal reserve bank may receive from the member banks as
reserves, not exceeding one-half of each installment, eligible paper as

Pus. 43.) 23

described in section fourteen properly indorsed and acceptable to
the said reserve bank.

If a State bank or trust company is required by the law of its State
to keep its reserves either in its own vaults or with another State bank
or trust company, such reserve deposits so kept in such State bank
or trust company shall be construed, within the meaning of this sec-
tion, as if they were reserve deposits in a national bank in a reserve
or central reserve city for a period of three years after the Secretary
of the Treasury shall have officially announced the establishment: of a
Federal reserve bank in the district in which such State bank or
trust company is situate. Except as thus provided, no member
bank shall keep on deposit with any nonmember bank a sum in
excess of ten per centum of its own paid-up capital and surplus.
No member bank shall act as the medium or agent of a nonmember
bank in applying for or receiving discounts from a Federal reserve
bank under the provisions of this Act except by permission of the
Federal Reserve Board.

The reserve carried by a member bank with a Federal reserve bank
may, under the regulations and subject to such penalties as may be
prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board, be checked against and
withdrawn by such member bank for the purpose of meeting existing
liabilities: Provided, however, That no bank shall at any time make
new loans or shall pay any dividends unless and until the total reserve
required by law is fully restored.

n estimating the reserves required by this Act, the net balance of
amounts due to and from other banks shall be taken as the basis for
ascertaining the deposits against which reserves shali be determined.
Balances in reserve banks due to member banks shail, to the extent
herein provided, be counted as reserves.

National banks located in Alaska or outside the continental United
States may remain nonmember banks, and shall in that event
maintain reserves and comply with all the conditions now provided
by law regulating them; or said banks, except in the Philippine
Islands, may, with the consent of the Reserve Board, become member
banks of any one of the reserve districts, and shall, in that event, take
stock, maintain reserves, and be subject to all the other provisions
of this Act.

Src. 20. So much of sections two and three of the Act of June
twentieth, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, entitled “An Act
fixing the amount of United States notes, providing for a redistribu-
tion of the national-bank currency, and for other purposes,” as pro-
vides that the fund deposited by any national banking association
with the Treasurer of the United States for the redemption of its notes
shall be counted as a part of its lawful reserve as provided in the Act
aforesaid, is hereby repealed. And from and after the passage of
this Act such fund of five per centum shall in no case be counted by
any national banking association as a part of its lawful reserve.

BANK EXAMINATIONS.

Src. 21. Section fifty-two hundred and forty, United States Re-
vised Statutes, is amended to read as follows:

The Comptroller of the Currency, with the approval of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, shall appoint examiners who shall examine
94 (Pus. 43)

every member bank at least twice in each calendar year and oftener
if considered necessary: Provided, however, That the Federal Reserve
Board may authorize examination by the State authorities to be
accepted in the case of State banks and trust companies and may at
any time direct the holding of a special examination of State banks
or trust companies that are stockholders in any Federal reserve
bank. The examiner making the examination of any national bank,
or of any other member bank, shall have power to make a thorough
examination of all the affairs of the bank and in doing so he shall
have power to administer oaths and to examine any of the officers
and agents thereof under oath-and shall make a full and detailed
report of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency.

The Federal Reserve Board, upon the recommendation of the
Comptroller of the Currency, shall fix the salaries of all bank exam-
iners and make report thereof to Congress. The expense of the
examinations herein provided for shall be assessed by the Comptroller
of the Currency upon the banks examined in proportion to assets or
resources held by the banks upon the dates of examination of the
various banks.

In addition to the examinations made and conducted by the
Comptroller of the Currency, every Federal reserve bank may, with
the approval of the Federal reserve agent or the Federal Reserve Board,

rovide for special examination of member banks within its district.

he expense of such examinations shall be borne by the bank exam-
ined. Such examinations shall be so conducted as to inform the
Federal reserve bank of the condition of its member banks and of the
lines of credit which are being extended by them. Every Federal
reserve bank shall at all times furnish to the Federal Reserve Board
such information as may be demanded concerning the condition of
any member bank within the district of the said Federal reserve bank.

Xo bank shall be subject to any visitatorial powers other than such
as are authorized by law, or vested in the courts of justice or such as
shall be or shall have been exercised or directed by Congress, or by
either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either
House duly authorized.

The Federal Reserve Board shall, at least once each year, order an
examination of each Federal reserve bank, and upon joint applica-
tion of ten member banks the Federal Reserve Board shall order a
special examination and report of the condition of any Federal
reserve bank.

Src. 22. No member bank or any officer, director, or employee
thereof shall hereafter make any loan or grant any gratuity to any
bank examiner. Any bank officer, director, or employee violat-
ing this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall
be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined not more than $5,000,
or both; and may be fined a further sum equal to the money so loaned
or gratuity given. Any examiner accepting a loan or gratuity from any
bank examined by him or from an officer, director, or employee thereof
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be imprisoned not
exceeding one year or fined not more than $5,000, or both; and may be
fined a further sum equal to the money so loaned or gratuity given;
and shall forever thereafter be disqualified from holding office as
national-bank examiner. No national-bank examiner shall perform

(Pus. 43.} 25

any other service for compensation while holding such office for any
bank or officer, director, or employee thereof.

Other than the usual salary or director’s fee paid to any officer,
director, or employee of a member bank and other than a reasonable
fee paid by said bank to such officer, director, or employee for services
rendered to such bank, no officer, director, employee, or attorney of a
member bank shall be a beneficiary of or receive, directly or indirectly,
any fee, commission, gift, or other consideration for or in connection
with any transaction or business of the bank. No examiner, public
or private, shall disclose the names of borrowers or the collateral for
loans of a member bank to other than the proper officers of such
bank without first having obtained the express permission in writing
from the Comptroller of the Currency, or from the board of directors
of such bank, except when ordered to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or by direction of the Congress of the United States, or
of either House thereof, or any committee of Congress or of either
House duly authorized. Any person violating any provision of this
section shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or by
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.

xcept as provided in existing laws, this provision shall not take
effect until sixty days after the passage of this Act.

Src. 23. The stockholders of every national banking association
shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and
engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock
therein, at the par value thereof in addition to the amount mvested
in such stock. ithe stockholders in any national banking association
who shall have transferred their shares or registered the transfer
thereof within sixty days next before the date of the failure of such
association to meet its obligations, or with knowledge of such im-
pending failure, shall be liable to the same extent as if they had made
no such transfer, to the extent that the subsequent transferee fails to
meet such liability; but this provision shall not be construed to
affect in any way any recourse which such shareholders might other-
wise have against those in whose names such shares are registered at
the time of such failure.

LOANS ON FARM LANDS.

Src. 24, Any national banking association not situated in a central
reserve city may make loans secured by improved and unencum-
bered farm land, situated within its Federal reserve district, but
no such loan shall be made for a longer time than five yours: nor
for an amount exceeding fifty per centum of the actual value of the
property offered as security. Any such bank may make such loans
in an aggregate sum equal to twenty-five per centum of its capital
and surplus orto one-third of its time deposits and such banks may
continue hereafter as heretofore to receive time deposits and to pay
interest on the same.

The Federal Reserve Board shall have power from time to time to
add to the list of cities in which national banks shall not be permitted
to make loans secured upon real estate in the manner described in
this section.
26 (Pup. 43)
FOREIGN BRANCHES.

Sno. 25. Any national banking association possessing a capital and
surplus of $1,000,000 or more may file application with the Federal
Reserve Board, upon such conditions and under such regulations as
may be prescribed by the said board, for the purpose of securing
authority to establish branches in foreign countries or dependencies
of the United States for the furtherance of the foreign commerce of
the United States, and to act, if required to do so, as fiscal agents of
the United States. Such application shall specify, in addition to the
name and capital of the banking association filing it, the place or
places where the banking operations proposed are to be carried on,
and the amount of capital set aside vor the conduct of its foreign
business. The Federal Reserve Board shall have power to approve
or to reject such application if, in its judgment, the amount of cap-
ital proposed to be set aside for the conduct of foreign business is
inadequate, or if for other reasons the granting of such application
is deemed inexpedient.

Every national banking association which shall receive authorit
to establish foreign branches shall be required at all times to furnis
information concerning the condition of such branches to the Comp-
troller of the Currency upon demand, and the Federal Reserve Board
may order special examinations of the said foreign branches at such
time or times as it may deem best. Every such national bankin
association shall conduct the accounts of each foreign branc
independently of the accounts of other foreign branches established
by it and of its home office, and shall at the end of each fiscal period
transfer to its general ledger the profit or loss accruing at each branch
as a separate item.

Seo. 26. Ali provisions of law inconsistent with or superseded by any
of the provisions of this Act are to that extent and to that extent only
hereby repealed: Provided, Nothing in this Act contained shall be con-
strued to repeal the parity provision or provisions contained in an
Act approved March fourteenth, nineteen hundred entitled ‘An
Act to define and fix the standard of value, to maintain the parity
of all forms of money issued or coined by the United States, to
refund the public debt, and for other purposes,” and the Secretary of
the Treasury may for the purpose of maintaining such parity and to
strengthen the gold reserve, borrow gold on the security of United
States bonds authorized by section two of the Act last referred to
or for one-year gold notes bearing interest at a rate of not to exceed
three per centum per annum, or sell the same if necessary to obtain
gold. When the funds of the Treasury on hand justify, he may
purchase and retire such outstanding bonds and notes.

Src. 27. The provisions of the Act of May thirtieth, nineteen
hundred and eight, authorizing national currency associations, the
issue of additional national-bank circulation, and creating a National
Monetary Commission, which expires by limitation under the terms
of such Act on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred and four-
teen, are hereby extended to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and
fifteen, and sections fifty-one hundred and fifty-three, fifty-one
hundred and seventy-two, fifty-one hundred and ninety-one, and
fifty-two hundred and fourteen of the Revised Statutes of the United
States, which were amended by the Act of May thirtieth, nineteen

{Pun. 43.) 27

hundred and eight, are hereby reenacted to read as such sections
read prior to May thirtieth, nineteen hundred and eight, subject to
such amendments or modifications as are prescribed in this Act:
Provided, however, That section nine of the Act first referred to in
this section is hereby amended so as to change the tax rates fixed
in said Act by making, the portion applicable thereto read as follows:

National banking associations having circulating notes secured
otherwise than by bonds of the United States, shall pay for the first
three months a tax at the rate of three per centum per annum upon
the average amount of such of their notes in circulation as are based
upon the deposit of such securities, and afterwards an additional tax
rate of one-half of one per centum per annum for each month until a
tax of six per centum per annum Is reached, and thereafter such tax
of six per centum per annum upon the average amount of such
notes.

Src. 28. Section fifty-one hundred and forty-three of the Revised
Statutes is hereby amended and reenacted to read as follows: Any
association formed under this title may, by the vote of sharcholders
owning two-thirds of its capital stock, reduce its capital to any sum
not below the amount required by this title to authorize the forma-
tion of associations; but no such reduction shall be allowable which
will reduce the capital of the association below the amount required
for its outstanding circulation, nor shall any reduction be made until
the amount of the proposed reduction has been reported to the Comp-
troller of the Currency and such reduction has been approved by the
said Comptroller of the Currency and by the Federal Reserve Board,
or by the organization committee pending the organization of the
Federal Reserve Board.

Src. 29. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, or part of this Act
shall for any reason be adjudged by any court of competent juris-
diction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or
invalidate the remainder of this Act, but shall be confined in its
operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, or part thereof directly
involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been
rendered.

Src. 30. The right to amend, alter, or repeal this Act is hereby
expressly reserved.

Approved, December 23, 1913.
