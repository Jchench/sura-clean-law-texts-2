§ 102. Findings and declaration of purpose

The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced
and the competition among the various financial institutions and other
firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strength-
ened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results
from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose
of this title to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that
the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit
terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.

sumer credit shall be determined, in accordance with the regulations of
the Board,

open end credit plan, as

(A) that nominal annual percentage rate which will yield a
sum equal to the amount of the finance charge when it is
applied to the unpaid balances of the amount financed, caleu-
lated according to the actuarial method of allocating pay-
ments made on a debt between the amount financed and the
amount of the finance charge, pursuant to which a payment is
applied first to the icoastihaion finance charge and the balance
is applied to the unpaid amount financed ; or

(B) the rate determined by any method prescribed by the
Board as a method which materially simplifies computation
while retaining reasonable accuracy as compared with the
rate determined under subparagraph (A).

(2) in the'case of any extension of credit under an open end
credit plan, as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of the total
finance charge for the period to which it relates divided by the
amount upon which the finance charge for that period is based,
multiplied by the number of such periods in a year.

(b) Where a creditor imposes the same finance charge for balances
within a specified range, the annual percentage rate shall be computed
on the median balance within the range, except that if the rd
determines that a rate so computed would not be meaningful, or would
be materially misleading, the annual percentage rate shall be com-
puted on such other basis as the Board may by regulation require.

(ec) The annual percentage rate may be rounded to the nearest
quarter of 1 percentum for credit transactions payable in substantially
equal installments when a creditor determines the total finance charge
on the basis of a single add-on, discount, periodic, or other rate, and
the rate is converted into an annual percentage rate under procedures
prescribed by the Board.

(d) The rd may authorize the use of rate tables or charts which
may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which v
from the rate determined in accordance with subsection (a) (1) (A) by
not more than such tolerances as the Board may allow. The Board
may not allow a tolerance greater than 8 per centum of that rate except
to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.

(e) In the case of creditors determining the annual percen’ rate
in a manner other than as described in subsection (cy or (d), the
Board may authorize other reasonable tolerances, —

(f) Prior to January 1, 1971, any rate required under this title to
be disclosed as a percentage rate may, at the option of the creditor,
be expressed in the form of the corresponding ratio of dollars per
hundred dollars. :

b) If there is more than one obligor, a creditor need not furnish a

statement of information required under this chapter to more than
one of them.

§ 122. Form of disclosure; additional information

suant to this chapter be made in the order set forth in this chapter.
und may permit the use of terminology different from that employed

as the residence of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor
shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the
third business day following the consummation of the transaction or
the delivery of the disclosures required under this section and all other
material disclosures required under this chapter, whichever is later,
by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board,

return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money,
downpayment, or otherwise, and shal] take any action necessary or
appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created

creditor does not. take possession of the property within ten days after
tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor
without obligation on his part to pay for it.

(ec) carer pean er any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment.
of receipt of any disclosures required under this title by a person to
whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does

gencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver

assignment, unless the assignment was involuntary, or the assignee
shows by a preponderance of evidence that it did not have reasonable
grounds to believe that the original creditor was engaged in violations
of this chapter, and that it maintained procedures reasonably adapted

TITLE II—EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANS-
ACTIONS

See.

201. Findings and purpose.

202. Amendments to title 18, United States Code.
203. Reports by Attorney General.

§ 201. Findings and purpose

(a) The Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Organized crime is interstate and international in charac-
ter. Its activities involve many billions of dollars each year. It is
directly responsible for Pro Ait willful injuries to person and
property, corruption of officials, and terrorization of countless
citizens. A substantial part of the income of organized crime is
generated by extortionate credit transactions.

(2) Extortionate credit transactions are characterized by the
use, or the express or implicit threat of the use, of violence or other
criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation, or propert
as a means of enforcing repayment. Among the factors whic
have rendered past efforts at prosecution almost wholly ineffective
has been the existence of exclusionary rules of evidence stricter
than necessary for the protection of constitutional rights.

(3) Extortionate credit transactions are carried on to a sub-
stantial extent in interstate and foreign commerce and through
the means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where
extortionate credit transactions are purely intrastate in character,
they nevertheless directly affect interstate and foreign commerce.

_ (4) Extortionate credit transactions directly impair the effec-
tiveness and frustrate the purposes of the laws enacted by the
Congress on the subject of bankruptcies.

(b) On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this
section, the Co btebtiiines that the provisions of chapter 42 of
title 18 of the United States Code are necessary and proper for the
purpose of carrying into execution the powers of Congress to regulate
commerce and to establish uniform and effective laws on the subject
of bankruptcy.

§ 202. Amendments to title 18, United States Code

(2) Title 18 of the United States Code is amended by inserting the
following new chapter immediately after chapter 41 thereof:

credit, refers to any person to whom that extension of credit is made, or

any person to make repayment thereof.

(6) An extortionate extension of credit is any extension of credit

forceability through civil judicial processes of repayment of any ex-
tension of credit or the EF gies Cah of any promise given in aie: Mae
tion thereof shall be suilicially noticed. This paragraph does not impair
any authority which any court would otherwise have to take judicial
notice of any matter of State law.

“§ 892. Making extortionate extensions of credit

“(a) Whoever makes any extortionate extension of credit, or con-
spires to do so, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not
more than 20 years, or both.

“(b) In any prosecution under this section, if it is shown that all of
the following factors were present in connection with the extension of
credit in question, there is prima facie evidence that the extension of
credit was extortionate, but this subsection is nonexclusive and in no
way limits the effect or applicability of subsection (a) :

“(1) The repayment of the extension of credit, or the perform-
ance of any promise given in consideration thereof, would be un-
enforceable, through civil judicial processes against the debtor

“(A) in the jurisdiction within which the debtor, if a
natural person, resided or
“(B) inevery jurisdiction within which the debtor, if other
than a natural person, was incorporated or qualified to do
business
at the time the extension of credit was made.
82 Srar. ] PUBLIC LAW 90-321—MAY 29, 1968

“(2) The extension of credit was made at a rate of interest in
excess of an annual rate of 45 per centum calculated according to
the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt be-
tween principal and interest, pursuant to which a payment is ap-
plied first to the accumulated interest and the balance is applied
to the unpaid principal.

“(3) At the time the extension of credit was made, the debtor
reasonably believed that either

W(A) one or more extensions of credit by the creditor had
been collected or attempted to be collected by extortionate

“(B) the creditor had a reputation for the use of extor-
tionate means to collect extensions of credit or to punish the
nonrepayment thereof.

“(4) Upon the making of the extension of credit, the total of the
extensions of credit by the creditor to the debtor then outstanding,
including any unpaid interest or similar charges, exceeded $100.

“(e) In any prosecution under this section, if evidence has been intro-
duced tending to show the existence of any of the circumstances de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) or (b) (2), and direct evidence of the
actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor's collection practices is not
available, then for the purpose of showing the understanding of the
debtor and the creditor at the time the extension of credit was made,
the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced tending
to show the reputation as to collection practices of the creditor in any
community of which the debtor was a member at the time of the ex-
tension.

“§ 893. Financing extortionate extensions of credit

“Whoever willfully advances money or property, whether as a gift,
as 2 loan, as an investment, pursuant to a partnership or ge clbencine
agreement, or otherwise, to an rson, with reasonable grounds to

erty so advanced directly or indirectly for the purpose of making
extortionate extensions of credit, shall be fined not more than $10,000
or an amount not exceeding twice the value of the money or property
so advanced, whichever is greater, or shall be imprisoned not more
than 20 years, or both.

“§ 894. Collection of extensions of credit by extortionate means

“(a) Whoever knowingly participates in any way, or conspires to do
so, in the use of — extortionate means

“(1) to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit, or
“(2) to punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof,
shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 20
years, or both.

“(b) In any prosecution under this section, for the purpose of show-
ing an implicit threat as a means of collection, evidence may be intro-
duced tending to show that one or more extensions of credit by the
creditor were, to the knowledge of the person against whom the implicit
threat was alleged to have made, collected or attempted to be
collected by extortionate means or that the nonrepayment thereof was
punished by extortionate means.

“(c) In any prosecution under this section, if evidence has been
introduced tending to show the existence, at the time the extension of
credit in question was made, of the circumstances described in section
892(b) (1) or the circumstances described in section 892(b) (2), and

that words or other means of communication, shown to have been
employed as a means of collection, in fact carried an express or implicit
threat, the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced
tending to show the reputation of the defendant in any community of
which the person against whom the alleged threat was made was a
member at the time of the collection or attempt at collection.

“§ 895. Immunity of witnesses

“Whenever in the judgment of a United States attorney the testi-
mony of any witness, or the production of books, papers, or other evi-
dence by any witness in any case or proceeding before any grand jury

necessary to the public interest, he, upon the approval of the Attorney
General or his designated representative, may make application to the
court that the witness be instructed to testify or produce evidence
subject to the provisions of this section. Upon order of the court the
witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books,
papers, or other evidence on the ground that the testimony or evidence
required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a

nalty or forfeiture. But no such witness may be prosecuted or sub-
jected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any trans-
action, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having
claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce
evidence, nor may testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any
criminal proceeding against him in any court, except a prosecution for
perjury or contempt committed while giving testimony or producing
evidence under compulsion as provided in this section.

“This chapter does not preempt any field of law with respect to
which State legislation would be permissible in the absence of this
chapter. No Jaw of any State which would be valid in the absence of
this chapter may be held invalid or, inapplicable by virtue of the

82 Srart. | PUBLIC LAW 90-321—MAY 29, 1968

§ 301. Findings and purpose

(a) The Congress finds:

(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for per-
sonal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of
credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit
payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in
interstate commerce.

(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors’ remedy fre-
quently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the result-
ing disruption of employment, production, and consumption
constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.

(8) The great disparities among the laws of the several States
relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of
the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many
areas of the country.

(b) On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this sec-
tion, the Congress determines that the provisions of this title are neces-
sary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers
of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bank-
ruptey laws.

§ 302. Definitions

For the purposes of this title:

(a) The term “earnings” means compensation paid or payable for
versonal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission,
onus, or otherwise, and includes periodic payments pursuant to a

pension or retirement program.

(b) The term “disposable earnings” means that part of the earnings
of any individual remaining after he deduction from those earnings of
any amounts required by law to be withheld.

(c) The term “garnishment” means any legal or equitable procedure
through which the earnings of any individual are required to be with-
held for payment of any debt.

§ 303. Restriction on garnishment

(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section 305, the
maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual
for any workweek whack is subjected to garnishment may not exceed

ta 25 per centum of his disposable earnings for that week, or
(2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that week
exceed thirty times the Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed
by section 6(a) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in
effect at the time the earnings are payable,
whichever is less. In the case of earnings for any pay period other than
a week, the Secretary of Labor shall by regulation prescribe a multiple
of the Federal minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set
forth in paragraph (2).
(b) The restrictions of subsection (a) do not apply in the case of
(1) any order of any court for the support of any person.
(2) any order of any court of bankruptcy under chapter XIIT
of the Bankruptcy Act.
(3) any debt due for any State or Federal tax.

(c) No court of the United States or any State may make, execute,
or enforce any order or process in violation of this section.

§ 304. Restriction on discharge from employment by reason of
garnishment

(a) No employer may discharge any employee by reason of the
fact that his earnings have been sabjeeted to garnishment for any one
indebtedness.

§ 305. Exemption for State-regulated garnishments

The Secretary of Labor may by regulation exempt from the pro-
visions of section 303(a) garnishments issued under the laws of any
State if he determines that the laws of that State provide restrictions
on garnishment which are substantially similar to those provided in
section 303 (a).

§ 306. Enforcement by Secretary of Labor

The Secretary of Labor, acting through the Wage and Hour Division
of the Department of Labor, shall enforce the provisions of this title.
