(a) IN GENERAL.—It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal "”

fund, consistent with the least-cost and prompt corrective action
provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

(b) GENERAL PrincrpLes.—In encouraging the Federal banking
agencies to pursue early resolution strategies, the Congress con-
templates that any resolution transaction under section 13(c) of that

negotiated competitively, taking into account the value of
expediting the process.

sured depository institution created or assisted in the trans-

ment of the resulting institution should be qualified to perform
their duties, and should not include individuals substantially
responsible for the troubled institution’s problems.

(6) FDIC’s participation.—The transaction should give the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation an opportunity to
participate in the success of the resulting institution.

(7) SrRUCTURE OF TRANSACTION.—The transaction should,
insofar as practical, be structured so that—

(A) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—

(i) does not acquire a significant proportion of the
troubled institution’s problem assets;

(ii) succeeds to the interests of the troubled institu-
tion’s preexisting owners and debtholders in proportion
to the assistance the Corporation provides; and

(iii) limits the Corporation’s assistance in term and
amount; and

(B) new investors share risk with the Corporation.

Subtitle J—Sense of the Congress Regarding
the Credit Crisis

SEC, 456. CREDIT CRUNCH.

(a) Finpines.—The Congress finds that—

(1) during the past year and a half a credit crunch of crisis
proportions has taken hold of the economy and grown increas-
ingly severe, particularly for real estate;

(2) to date the credit crisis has shown no sign of improvement
with its effects being felt broadly throughout the Nation as
business failures soar, financial institutions weaken, real estate
— decline, and State and local property tax bases further
erode;

(3) approximately $200,000,000,000 of the nearly
$400,000,000,000 in commercial real estate loans now held by
commercial banks are coming due within the next 2 years;

(4) banks for a variety of reasons, are reluctant to renew these
maturing real estate loans;

(5) both pension funds in the United States, with assets of
nearly $2,000,000,000,000, and a stronger and more active
secondary market for commercial real estate debt and equity
could play a more significant role in providing liquidity and
credit to the real estate and banking sectors of the economy;

(6) many regulatory practices encourage banks to reduce their
ce estate lending without regard to long-term historical risk;
an

(7) the stability of real estate has suffered during the past
decade first from tax rules that in 1981 stimulated excessive
investment in real estate, and then in 1986 when rules were
adopted that discourage capital investment in real estate, artifi-
cially eroding real estate values.

(b) SENSE OF THE CoNGRESS.—It is the sense of the Congress that—

(1) immediate and carefully-coordinated action should be
taken by the Congress and the President to arrest the credit
crisis referred to in subsection (a) and provide a healthy and
efficient marketplace that works for owners, lenders, and inves-
tors; and

Pr that efforts should be undertaken to explore measures
that—
105 STAT. 2384

PUBLIC LAW 102-242—DKEC. 19, 1991

(A) modernize and simplify the rules that apply to pen-
sion investment in real estate to remove unnecessary
riers to pension funds seeking to invest in real estate;

(B) strengthen the secondary market for commercial real
