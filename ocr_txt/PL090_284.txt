EDUCATION AND CONCILIATION

SEc. 809. Immediately after the enactment of this title the Sec-
retary shall commence such educational and conciliatory activities
as in his judgment will further the purposes of this title. He shall
call conferences of persons in the housing industry and other inter-
ested parties to acquaint them with the provisions of this title and

their advice to work out programs of voluntary compliance and of
enforcement. He may pay per diem, travel, and transportation ex-
penses for persons attending such conferences as provided in sec-
tion 5703 of title 5 of the United States Code. He shall consult with
State and local officials and other interested parties to learn the
extent, if any, to which housing discrimination exists in their State
or locality, and whether and how State or local enforcement pro-
grams might be utilized to combat such discrimination in connec-
tion with or in place of, the Secretary’s enforcement of this title.
The Secretary shall issue reports on such conferences and consulta-
tions as he deems appropriate.

(ii) Such complaints shall be in writing and shall contain such
information and be in such form as the Secretary requires.

(iii) The Secretary may also investigate housing practices to de-
termine whether a complaint should be brought under this section.

(B) Upon the filing of such a complaint—

(i) the Secretary shall serve notice upon the aggrieved per-
son acknowledging such filing and advising the aggrieved per-
son of the time limits and choice of forums provided under this
title;

(ii) the Secretary shall, not later than 10 days after such
filing or the identification of an additional respondent under
paragraph (2), serve on the respondent a notice identifying the
alleged discriminatory housing practice and advising such re-
spondent of the procedural rights and obligations of respond-
ents under this title, together with a copy of the original com-
plaint;

(iii) each respondent may file, not later than 10 days after
receipt of notice from the Secretary, an answer to such com-
plaint; and

(iv) the Secretary shall make an investigation of the al-
leged discriminatory housing practice and complete such inves-
tigation within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or,
when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2)
with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the com-
mencement of such further action), unless it is impracticable to
do so.

(C) If the Secretary is unable to complete the investigation
within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Sec-
retary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) with respect to
a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such fur-
ther action), the Secretary shall notify the complainant and re-
spondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.

(D) Complaints and answers shall be under oath or affirma-
tion, and may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.

(2)(A) A person who is not named as a respondent in a com-
plaint, but who is identified as a respondent in the course of inves-
tigation, may be joined as an additional or substitute respondent
upon written notice, under paragraph (1), to such person, from the
Secretary.

(B) Such notice, in addition to meeting the requirements of
paragraph (1), shall explain the basis for the Secretary’s belief that
the person to whom the notice is addressed is properly joined as
a respondent.

(b) INVESTIGATIVE REPORT AND CONCILIATION.—(1) During the
period beginning with the filing of such complaint and ending with
the filing of a charge or a dismissal by the Secretary, the Secretary

(2) A conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation
shall be an agreement between the respondent and the complain-
ant, and shall be subject to approval by the Secretary.

(3) A conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitra-

that results from a conciliation agreement may award appropriate
relief, including monetary relief.

(4) Each conciliation agreement shall be made public unless
the complainant and respondent otherwise agree and the Secretary
determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes
of this title.

(5)(A) At the end of each investigation under this section, the
Secretary shall prepare a final investigative report containing—

(i) the names and dates of contacts with witnesses;

(ji) a summary and the dates of correspondence and other
contacts with the aggrieved person and the respondent;

(iii) a summary description of other pertinent records;

(iv) a summary of witness statements; and

(v) answers to interrogatories.

(B) A final report under this paragraph may be amended if ad-
ditional evidence is later discovered.

(c) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CONCILIATION AGREEMENT.—

spondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the Secretary
shall refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommenda-
tion that a civil action be filed under section 814 for the enforce-
ment of such agreement.

(d) PROHIBITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DIs-
CLOSURE OF INFORMATION.—(1) Nothing said or done in the course
of conciliation under this title may be made public or used as evi-
dence in a subsequent proceeding under this title without the writ-
ten consent of the persons concerned.

available to the aggrieved person and the respondent, at any time,
upon request following completion of the Secretary’s investigation,
information derived from an investigation and any final investiga-
tive report relating to that investigation.

(e) PROMPT JUDICIAL ACTION.—(1) If the Secretary concludes at
any time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial ac-
tion is necessary to carry out the purposes of this title, the Sec-
retary may authorize a civil action for appropriate temporary or
preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint under
this section. Upon receipt of such an authorization, the Attorney
General shall promptly commence and maintain such an action.
Any temporary restraining order or other order granting prelimi-
nary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The commencement of a civil ac-
tion under this subsection does not affect the initiation or continu-
ation of administrative proceedings under this section and section
812 of this title.

(2) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that a basis
may exist for the commencement of proceedings against any re-
spondent under sections 814(a) and 814(c) or for proceedings by
any governmental licensing or supervisory authorities, the Sec-
retary shall transmit the information upon which such belief is
based to the Attorney General, or to such authorities, as the case
may be.

Fi (A) within the jurisdiction of a State or local public agency;
an

(B) as to which such agency has been certified by the Sec-
retary under this subsection;

the Secretary shall refer such complaint to that certified agency be-
fore taking any action with respect to such complaint.

(2) Except with the consent of such certified agency, the Sec-
retary, after that referral is made, shall take no further action with
respect to such complaint unless—

(A) the certified agency has failed to commence pro-
ceedings with respect to the complaint before the end of the
30th day after the date of such referral;

(B) the certified agency, having so commenced such pro-
ceedings, fails to carry forward such proceedings with reason-
able promptness; or

(C) the Secretary determines that the certified agency no
longer qualifies for certification under this subsection with re-
spect to the relevant jurisdiction.

(3)(A) The Secretary may certify an agency under this sub-
section only if the Secretary determines that—

(i) the substantive rights protected by such agency in the
jurisdiction with respect to which certification is to be made;

(ii) the procedures followed by such agency;

(iii) the remedies available to such agency; and

(iv) the availability of judicial review of such agency’s ac-
tion;

are substantially equivalent to those created by and under this
title.

(B) Before making such certification, the Secretary shall take
into account the current practices and past performance, if any, of
such agency.

(4) During the period which begins on the date of the enact-
ment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and ends 40
months after such date, each agency certified (including an agency
certified for interim referrals pursuant to 24 CFR 115.11, unless
such agency is subsequently denied recognition under 24 CFR
115.7) for the purposes of this title on the day before such date
shall for the purposes of this subsection be considered certified
under this subsection with respect to those matters for which such
agency was certified on that date. If the Secretary determines in
an individual case that an agency has not been able to meet the
certification requirements within this 40-month period due to ex-
ceptional circumstances, such as the infrequency of legislative ses-
sions in that jurisdiction, the Secretary may extend such period by
not more than 8 months.

(5) Not less frequently than every 5 years, the Secretary shall
determine whether each agency certified under this subsection con-
tinues to qualify for certification. The Secretary shall take appro-
priate action with respect to any agency not so qualifying.

(g) REASONABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION AND EFFECT.—(1) The
Secretary shall, within 100 days after the filing of the complaint
(or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2)
with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commence-
ment of such further action), determine based on the facts whether

reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing
practice has occurred or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable
to do so, or unless the Secretary has approved a conciliation agree-
ment with respect to the complaint. If the Secretary is unable to
make the determination within 100 days after the filing of the com-
plaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under sub-
section (f)(2) with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the
commencement of such further action), the Secretary shall notify
the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not
doing so.

(2)(A) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subpara-
graph (C), immediately issue a charge on behalf of the aggrieved
person, for further proceedings under section 812.

(B) Such charge—

(i) shall consist of a short and plain statement of the facts
upon which the Secretary has found reasonable cause to be-
lieve that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur;

(ii) shall be based on the final investigative report; and

(iii) need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in
the complaint filed under section 810(a).

(C) If the Secretary determines that the matter involves the le-
gality of any State or local zoning or other land use law or ordi-
nance, the Secretary shall immediately refer the matter to the At-
torney General for appropriate action under section 814, instead of
issuing such charge.

(3) If the Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is
about to occur, the Secretary shall promptly dismiss the complaint.
The Secretary shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.

(4) The Secretary may not issue a charge under this section re-
garding an alleged discriminatory housing practice after the begin-
ning of the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party
under an Act of Congress or a State law, seeking relief with respect
to that discriminatory housing practice.

(h) SERVICE OF COPIES OF CHARGE.—After the Secretary issues
a charge under this section, the Secretary shall cause a copy there-
of, together with information as to how to make an election under
section 812(a) and the effect of such an election, to be served—

(1) on each respondent named in such charge, together
with a notice of opportunity for a hearing at a time and place
specified in the notice, unless that election is made; and

(2) on each aggrieved person on whose behalf the com-
plaint was filed.

same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or discovery were
ordered or served in aid of a civil action in the United States dis-
trict court for the district in which the investigation is taking place.

(b) WITNESS FEES.—Witnesses summoned by a subpoena under
this title shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as
witnesses in proceedings in United States district courts. Fees pay-
able to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request
of a party shall be paid by that party or, where a party is unable
to pay the fees, by the Secretary.

(c) CRIMINAL PENALTIES.—(1) Any person who willfully fails or
neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or
to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if it is in such
person’s power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or other law-
ful order under subsection (a), shall be fined not more than
$100,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

(2) Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead another
person in any proceeding under this title—

(A) makes or causes to be made any false entry or state-
ment of fact in any report, account, record, or other document
produced pursuant to subpoena or other lawful order under
subsection (a);

(B) willfully neglects or fails to make or to cause to be
made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts,

shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more than
one year, or both.

the charge relates.

(b) ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HEARING IN ABSENCE OF ELEC-
TION.—If an election is not made under subsection (a) with respect

opportunity for a hearing on the record with respect to a charge
issued under section 810. The Secretary shall delegate the conduct
of a hearing under this section to an administrative law judge ap-
pointed under section 3105 of title 5, United States Code. The ad-
ministrative law judge shall conduct the hearing at a place in the
vicinity in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to

party may appear in person, be represented by counsel, present
evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and obtain the issuance of sub-

istrative proceedings under this section regarding any alleged dis-
criminatory housing practice after the beginning of the trial of a
civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under an Act of Con-
gress or a State law, seeking relief with respect to that discrimina-
tory housing practice.

(g) HEARINGS, FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS, AND ORDER.—(1)
The administrative law judge shall commence the hearing under
this section no later than 120 days following the issuance of the
charge, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the administrative law
judge is unable to commence the hearing within 120 days after the

thereafter, the administrative law judge shall notify the Secretary,
the aggrieved person on whose behalf the charge was filed, and the
respondent, in writing of the reasons for not doing so.

(3) If the administrative law judge finds that a respondent has
engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory housing practice,
such administrative law judge shall promptly issue an order for
such relief as may be appropriate, which may include actual dam-
ages suffered by the aggrieved person and injunctive or other equi-
table relief. Such order may, to vindicate the public interest, assess
a civil penalty against the respondent—

(A) in an amount not exceeding $10,000 if the respondent
has not been adjudged to have committed any prior discrimina-
tory housing practice;

has been adjudged to have committed one other discriminatory
housing practice during the 5-year period ending on the date

(C) in an amount not exceeding $50,000 if the respondent
has been adjudged to have committed 2 or more discriminatory
housing practices during the 7-year period ending on the date
of the filing of this charge;

except that if the acts constituting the discriminatory housing prac-
tice that is the object of the charge are committed by the same nat-
ural person who has been previously adjudged to have committed
acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice, then the civil
penalties set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) may be imposed
without regard to the period of time within which any subsequent
discriminatory housing practice occurred.

(4) No such order shall affect any contract, sale, encumbrance,
or lease consummated before the issuance of such order and involv-
ing a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual
notice of the charge filed under this title.

housing practice that occurred in the course of a business subject
to a licensing or regulation by a governmental agency, the Sec-

and the order, to that governmental agency; and

(B) recommend to that governmental agency appropriate
disciplinary action (including, where appropriate, the suspen-
sion or revocation of the license of the respondent).

(6) In the case of an order against a respondent against whom
another order was issued within the preceding 5 years under this
section, the Secretary shall send a copy of each such order to the
Attorney General.

(7) If the administrative law judge finds that the respondent
has not engaged or is not about to engage in a discriminatory hous-
ing practice, as the case may be, such administrative law judge
shall enter an order dismissing the charge. The Secretary shall
make public disclosure of each such dismissal.

(h) REVIEW BY SECRETARY; SERVICE OF FINAL ORDER.—(1) The
Secretary may review any finding, conclusion, or order issued
under subsection (g). Such review shall be completed not later than
30 days after the finding, conclusion, or order is so issued; other-
wise the finding, conclusion, or order becomes final.

sions of law made with respect to any final order for relief under
this section, together with a copy of such order, to be served on
each aggrieved person and each respondent in the proceeding.

(i) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—(1) Any party aggrieved by a final order
for relief under this section granting or denying in whole or in part
the relief sought may obtain a review of such order under chapter
158 of title 28, United States Code.

(j) COURT ENFORCEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER UPON PE-
TITION BY SECRETARY.—(1) The Secretary may petition any United
States court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory
housing practice is alleged to have occurred or in which any re-
spondent resides or transacts business for the enforcement of the
order of the administrative law judge and for appropriate tem-
porary relief or restraining order, by filing in such court a written
petition praying that such order be enforced and for appropriate
temporary relief or restraining order.

(2) The Secretary shall file in court with the petition the record
in the proceeding. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith trans-
mitted by the clerk of the court to the parties to the proceeding be-
fore the administrative law judge.

(k) RELIEF WHICH MAY BE GRANTED.—(1) Upon the filing of a
petition under subsection (i) or (j), the court may—

(A) grant to the petitioner, or any other party, such tem-
porary relief, restraining order, or other order as the court
deems just and proper;

(B) affirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the
order, or remand the order for further proceedings; and

(C) enforce such order to the extent that such order is af-
firmed or modified.

(2) Any party to the proceeding before the administrative law
judge may intervene in the court of appeals.

(3) No objection not made before the administrative law judge
shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to
urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary cir-
cumstances.

(1) ENFORCEMENT DECREE IN ABSENCE OF PETITION FOR RE-
VIEW.—If no petition for review is filed under subsection (i) before
the expiration of 45 days after the date the administrative law
judge’s order is entered, the administrative law judge’s findings of
fact and order shall be conclusive in connection with any petition
for enforcement—

(1) which is filed by the Secretary under subsection (j)
after the end of such day; or

(2) under subsection (m).

(m) COURT ENFORCEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER UPON
PETITION OF ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO RELIEF.—If before the expi-
ration of 60 days after the date the administrative law judge’s
order is entered, no petition for review has been filed under sub-
section (i), and the Secretary has not sought enforcement of the
order under subsection (j), any person entitled to relief under the
order may petition for a decree enforcing the order in the United
States court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory
housing practice is alleged to have occurred.

(n) ENTRY OF DECREE.—The clerk of the court of appeals in
which a petition for enforcement is filed under subsection (1) or (m)
shall forthwith enter a decree enforcing the order and shall trans-
mit a copy of such decree to the Secretary, the respondent named
in the petition, and to any other parties to the proceeding before
the administrative law judge.

FOR SUCH CIVIL ACTION.—(1) If an election is made under sub-
section (a), the Secretary shall authorize, and not later than 30
days after the election is made the Attorney General shall com-
mence and maintain, a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved per-

ter 87 of title 28, United States Code.

(2) Any aggrieved person with respect to the issues to be deter-
mined in a civil action under this subsection may intervene as of
right in that civil action.

(3) In a civil action under this subsection, if the court finds
that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to
occur, the court may grant as relief any relief which a court could
grant with respect to such discriminatory housing practice in a civil
action under section 813. Any relief so granted that would accrue
to an aggrieved person in a civil action commenced by that ag-
grieved person under section 813 shall also accrue to that ag-
grieved person in a civil action under this subsection. If monetary
relief is sought for the benefit of an aggrieved person who does not
intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief
if that aggrieved person has not complied with discovery orders en-
tered by the court.

(p) ATTORNEYS FEES.—In any administrative proceeding
brought under this section, or any court proceeding arising there-
from, or any civil action under section 812, the administrative law
judge or the court, as the case may be, in its discretion, may allow
the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonably at-
torney’s fee and costs. The United States shall be liable for such
fees and costs to the extent provided by section 504 of title 5,
gnited States Code, or by section 2412 of title 28, United States

ode.

such discriminatory housing practice or breach.

(B) The computation of such 2-year period shall not include
