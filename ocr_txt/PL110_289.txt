“(1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or
“(2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the

Director may give less than full credit for purchases of invest-

ment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not

provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.

“(c) MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE.—The Director shall mon-
itor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals estab-
lished under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for
purposes of section 1336) based on whether the rent levels are
affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for
purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not
exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income
category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured
by the number of bedrooms.

Program;

of mortgage debt to income, taking into consideration all
existing mortgages of that mortgagor at such time, greater
than 31 percent (or such higher amount as the Board
determines appropriate).

“(2) DETERMINATION OF PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION AMOUNT.—
The principal obligation amount of the refinanced eligible mort-
gage to be insured shall—

“(A) be determined by the reasonable ability of the
mortgagor to make his or her mortgage payments, as such
ability is determined by the Secretary pursuant to section
203(b)(4) or by any other underwriting standards estab-
lished by the Board; and

consummation of a transaction, if the consumer determines
that the extension of credit is needed to meet a bona fide
personal financial emergency, the consumer may waive or
modify the timing requirements for disclosures under subpara-
graph (A), provided that—

“i) the term ‘bona fide personal emergency’ may be
further defined in regulations issued by the Board;
