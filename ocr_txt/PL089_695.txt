to which it is a party or in which it is interested, and in the admin-

ized to act in its own name and through its own attorneys. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Bieat shall be subject to suit (other
than suits on claims for money damages) by any Federal savings and
loan association or director or officer thereof with respect to any
matter under this section or any other applicable law, or rules or
regulations thereunder, in the United States district court for the
judicial district in which the home office of the association is located,
or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
and the Board may be served with process in the manner prescribed
by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(2) (A) If, in the opinion of the Board, an association is violating
or has violated, or the Boaed has reasonable cause to believe that the
association is about to violate, a law, rule, regulation, or charter or
other condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with
the granting of any application or other request by the association, or
written agreement entered into with the Board, or is engaging or has
engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the associa-
tion is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice, the Board
may issue and serve upon the association a notice of charges in respect
thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting
the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or
practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held
to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should
issue against the association. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date
not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of
such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the
request of the association. Unless the association shall appear at the
hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have
consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of
such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board
shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified
in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and
serve upon the association an order to cease and desist from any such
violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be
mandatory or otherwise, require the association and its directors, offi-
cers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, fur-
ther, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from
any such violation or practice.

*“(B) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expira-
tion of thirty days after service of such order upon the association con-
cerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon con-
sent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and
shall remain effective and enforceable, except to such extent as it is
stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a
reviewing court.

“(3)(A) Whenever the Board shall determine that the violation
or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices,
specified in the notice of charges served upor the association pursuant
to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, or the continuation thereof,
is likely to cause insolvency (as defined in paragraph (6) (A) (i) of
this subsection) or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the
association, or is likely to otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of
its savings account holders, the Board may issue a temporary order
requiring the association to cease and desist from any such violation or
practice. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the as-
sociation and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in pro-
ceedings authorized by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, chall
remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the admin-
istrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the
Board shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice or, if a cease-
and-desist order is issued against the association, until the effective date
of any such order.

“(B) Within ten days after the association concerned has been
served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the association may
apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in
which the home office of the association is located, or the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting
aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effective-
ness of such order pending the completion of the administrative pro-
ceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the association
under paragraph (2) (A) of this subsection, and such court shall have
jurisdiction to issue such injunction.

s$ (C) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure
to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order, the Board may apply to
the United States district court, or the United States court of any ter-
ritory, within the jurisdiction of which the home office of the associa-
tion is located, for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the
court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened
violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue
such injunction.

“(4)(A) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any director or
officer of an association has committed any violation of law, rule, or
regulation, or of a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or
has engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in con-
nection with the association, or has committed or engaged in any act,
omission, or practice which constitutes a breach of his fiduciary duty
as such director or officer, and the Board determines that the associa-
tion has suffered or will probably suffer substantial financial loss or
other damage or that the interests of its savings account holders could
be seriously prejudiced by reason of such violation or practice or
breach of fiduciary duty, and that such violation or practice or breach
of fiduciary duty is one involving personal dishonesty on the part of
such director or officer, the Board may serve upon such director or offi-
cer a written notice of its intention to remove him from office.

of an association, by conduct or practice with respect to another sav-
ings and loan association or other business institution which resulted
in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his personal
dishonesty and unfitness to continue as a ditectur or officer, and, when-
ever, in the opinion of the Board, any other person participating in
the conduct of the affairs of an association, by conduct or practice
with respect to such association or other savings and loan association
or other business institution which resulted in substantial financial loss
or other damage, has evidenced his personal dishonesty and unfitness
to participate in the conduct of the affairs of such association, the
Board may serve upon such director, officer, or other person a written
notice of its intention to remove him from office and/or to prohibit his
further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of
such association.

“(C) In respect to any director or officer of an association or any
other person referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this para-
graph, the Board may, if it deems it necessary for the protection of
the association or the interests of its savings account holders, by written
notice to such effect served upon such director, officer, or other person,

tion in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the association.

wh) Within ten days after any director, officer, or other person
has been suspended from office aor prohibited from participation

home office of the association is located, or the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia, for a stay of such suspension and/or
prohibition pending the completion of the administrative proceedings
pursuant to the notice vat upon such director, officer, or other per-
son under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, and such court
shall have jurisdiction to stay such suspension and/or prohibition.

“(5)(A) Whenever any director or officer of an association, or
other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such asso-
ciation, is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint au-
thorized by a United States Attorney, with the commission of or par-
ticipation in a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the
Board may, by written notice served upon such director, officer, or
other person, suspend him from office and/or prohibit him from fur-
ther participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the
association. A copy of such notice shall also be served upon the asso-
ciation. Such suspension and/or prohibition shall remain in effect
until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of
or until terminated by the Board. In the event that a judgment of
conviction with respect to such offense is entered against such director,
officer, or other person, and at such time as such judgment is not sub-
ject to further appellate review, the Board may issue and serve upon
such director, officer, or other person an order removing him from
office and/or prohibiting him from further participation In any man-
ner in the conduct of the affairs of the association except with the
consent of the Board. A copy of such order shall be served upon such

other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from
thereafter instituting proceedings to remove such director, officer, or
other person from office and/or to prohibit further participation in
association affairs, pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of para-
graph (4) of this subsection.

“{B) if at any time, because of the suspension of one or more

suspended, all powers and functions vested in or exercisable by such
board shall vest in and be exercisable by the director or directors on
the board and not so suspended, until such time as there shall be a
quorum of the board of directors. In the event all of the directors of
an association are suspended pursuant to this subsection (d), the
Board shal] na pme rsons to serve temporarily as directors in their
place and stead pending the termination of such suspensions, or un-
til such time as those who have been suspended cease to be directors
of the association and their respective successors take office.

(6) (A) The grounds for the appointment of a conservator or re-
ceiver for an association shall be one or more of the following: (i)
insolvency in that the assets of the association are less than its obliga-
tions to its creditors and others, including its members; (ii) substantial
dissipation of assets or earnings due to any violation or violations of

practices; (iii) an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business;

and the court shall upon the merits dismiss such action or direct the
Board to remove such conservator or receiver. Such proceedings shall
be given precedence over other cases pending in such courts, and shall
be in every way expedited. Upon the commencement of such an action,
the court having jurisdiction of any other action or proceeding author-
ized under this subsection to which the association is a party shall stay
such action or proceeding during the pendency of the action for re-
moval of the conservator or receiver.

“(B) In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Board may, with-
out any requirement of notice, hearing, or other action, appoint a
conservator or receiver for an association in the event that (i) the

oard. The Board may, without any requirement of notice, hearing,
or other action, replace a conservator with another conservator or with
2 receiver, but any such replacement shall not affect any right which
the association may have to obtain judicial review of the original

institution, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue opera-
tions as an insured institution, or is violating or has violated an ap-

upon the institution a statement with respect to such violations or
practices or conditions for the purpose of securing the correction
thereof, and shall send a copy of such statement to the appropriate
State supervisory authority.

“(2) Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and
twenty days after service of such statement, or such shorter period of
not less than twenty days after such service as (A) the Corporation
shall require in any case where the Corporation determines that its
insurance risk with respect to such institution could be unduly jeop-
ardized by further delay in the correction of such violations or prac-
tices or conditions, or (B) the appropriate State supervisory authority
shall require, or unless within such time the Corporation shall have
received acceptable assurances that such correction will be made with-
in a time and in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation, or in the
event such assurances are submitted to and accepted by the Corpora-
tion but are not carried out in accordance with their terms, the Cor-
poration may, if it shall determine to proceed further, issue and serve
upon the institution written notice of intention to terminate the status
of the institution as an insured institution.

the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice
or practices or condition, and shall fix a time and place for a hearing

tion. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any
such hearing the Corporation shall find that any violation or unsafe
or unsound practice or condition specified in such notice has been
established and has not been corrected within the time above prescribed
in which to make correction, the Corporation may issue and serve
upon the institution an order terminating the status of the institution
as an insured institution; but any such order shall not become effec-
tive until it is an order which has become final (except in the case of

which an order of termination issued under subsection (b) (8) of this
section becomes effective. The Corporation may from time to time
postpone the effective date of the termination of an institution’s status

tion is authorized to give reasonable notice.

“(e) CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS.—(1) If, in the opinion of

accounts of which are insured is engaging or has engaged, or the
Corporation has reasonable cause to believe that the institution is about
to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business
of such institution, or is violating or has violated, or the Corporation
has reasonable cause to believe that the institution is about to violate,
a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the
Corporation in connection with the granting of any application or
other request by the institution, or written agreement entered into with
the Corporation, including any agreement entered into under section
403 of this title, the Corporation may issue and serve upon the institu-
tion a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a
statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations
or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time
and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order
to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the institution. Such
hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later
than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a
later date is set by the Corporation at the request of the institution.
Unless the institution shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized
representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance
of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if
upon the record made at any such hearing the Corporation shall find
that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice
of charges has been established, the Corporation may issue and serve
upon the institution an order to cease and desist from any such viola-
tion or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be manda-
tory or otherwise, require the institution and its directors, officers,
employees, and agents to cease and desist from the same, and, further

stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Corporation
or a reviewing court.

“(f) Temporary CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS.—(1) Whenever the Cor-
poration shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or
the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice
of charges served upon the institution pursuant to subsection (e) (1) of
this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or
substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the institution, or is
likely to otherwise seriously prejudice the interest of its insured mem-
bers or of the Corporation, the Corporation may issue a temporary
order requiring the institution to cease and desist from any such viola-
tion or practice. Such order shall become effective upon service upon

if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the institution, until the
effective date of any such order.

e 2) Within ten days after the institution concerned has been
served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the institution may
apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in
which the principal office of the institution is located, or the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction

to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order, the Corporation may
apply to the United States district court, or the United States court
of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the principal office
of the institution is located, for an injunction to enforce such order,
and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or
threatened violation or failure to obey, it shal] be the duty of the court
to issue such injunction.

ever, in the opinion of the Corporation, any director or officer of an
insured institution has committed any violation of law, rule, or -
lation, or of a cease-and-desist order which has become final, or has
engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in connec-
tion with the institution, or has committed or engaged in any act,
omission, or practice which constitutes a breach of his fiduciary duty
as such director or officer, and the Corporation determines that the
institution has suffered or will probably suffer substantial financial
loss or other damage or that the interests of its insured members could
be seriously prejudiced by reason of such violation or practice or
breach of fiduciary duty, and that such violation or practice or breach
of fiduciary duty is one involving personal dishonesty on the part of
such director or officer, the Corporation may serve upon such direc-
we or officer a written notice of its intention to remove him from
office.

(2) Whenever, in the opinion of the Corporation, any director or
officer of an insured institution, by conduct or practice with respect to
another insured institution or other business institution which re-
sulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his
personal dishonesty and unfitness to continue as a director or officer,
and, whenever, in the opinion of the Corporation, any other person par-
ticipating in the conduct of the affairs of an insured institution, by
conduct or practice with respect to such institution or other insured in-
stitution or other business institution which resulted in substantial
financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his personal dishonest
and unfitness to participate in the conduct of the affairs of suc
insured institution, the Corporation may serve upon such director,
officer, or other person a written notice of its intention to remove him
from office and/or to prohibit his further participation in any manner
in the conduct of the affairs of such institution.

bank, or Board of Governors of the Federal resin System in the
case of a State member bank as the case may be, the Board of Directors,

time above prescribed in which to make such corrections, the Board of
Directors may order that the insured status of the bank be terminated
on a date subsequent to such finding and to the expiration of the time
specified in such notice of intention. Unless the bank shall appear at
the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed
to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured bank
and termination of such status thereupon may be ordered. Any
insured bank whose insured status has been terminated by order of the
Board of Directors under this subsection shall have the right of judi-
