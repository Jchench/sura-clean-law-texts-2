rules for currency transaction reports described in section

without harming the usefulness of such filing rules to

(a) shall cover the period beginning at least 3 calendar years prior
to the date of enactment of this section.

include a detailed evaluation of—

(1) the extent to which depository institutions are availing
themselves of the exemption system for the filing of currency
transaction reports set forth in section 103.22(d) of title 31,
Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect during the study
period (in this section referred to as the “exemption system”),
including specifically, for the study period—

(A) the number of currency transaction reports filed
(out of the total annual numbers) involving companies that
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ
National Market;

by the 100 largest depository institutions in the United
States by asset size, and thereafter in tiers of 100, by
asset size;

(C) the number of currency transaction reports filed
by the 200 smallest depository institutions in the United
States, including the number of such currency transaction
reports involving companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market; and

would have been filed during the filing period if the exemp-
tion system had been used by all depository institutions
in the United States;

exemption system, and the extent to which such exemption
system is used;

tory institutions to reduce their currency transaction reports
reporting burden by making use of the exemption system,
including considerations of cost, especially in the case of small
depository institutions;

(4) the extent to which bank examination difficulties have
limited the use of the exemption system, especially with respect
to—

(A) the exemption of privately-held companies per-
mitted under such exemption system; and

examiners to implementation of such exemption system
is justified or inhibits use of such exemption system without
an offsetting compliance benefit;

(5) ways to improve the use of the exemption system by
depository institutions, including making such exemption
system mandatory in order to reduce the volume of currency
transaction reports unnecessarily filed; and

(6) the usefulness of currency transaction reports filed to
law enforcement agencies, taking into account—

(A) advances in information technology;

(B) the impact, including possible loss of investigative
data, that various changes in the exemption system would
have on the usefulness of such currency transaction reports;

system without affecting the usefulness of currency trans-
action reports.

sample of Federal, State, and local law enforcement and regulatory
officials and officials of depository institutions of all sizes.

(a) shall, if appropriate, include recommendations for changes to

cost to depository institutions, assuming reasonably full

usefulness of the currency transaction report filing system to anti-
terrorism, law enforcement, and regulatory operations.

ment of this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report
on the study required under subsection (a) to the Committee on

tions in the banking and financial services sector, including
the differences in capital, market share, geographical limita-

tion charters, including—

(A) identification of the historical trends in the evo-
lution of depository institution charters;

to the overall safety and soundness of the banking industry,
and the effectiveness of the applicable depository institution

of options for depository institution charters on the develop-
ment of the banking industry;

plexity among financial institutions makes with respect to regu-
latory oversight, efficiency, safety and soundness, and charter
options for financial institutions; and

(4) the aggregate cost and breakdown associated with regu-
latory compliance for banks, savings associations, credit unions,
or any other financial institution, including potential dispropor-
tionate impact that the cost of compliance may pose on smaller
institutions, given the percentage of personnel that the institu-
tion must dedicate solely to compliance.

(b) CONSIDERATIONS.—In conducting the study under subsection
(a), the Comptroller General shall consider the efficacy and effi-
ciency of the consolidation of financial regulators, as well as charter
simplification and homogenization.
