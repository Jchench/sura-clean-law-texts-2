“(5) NOTICE OF RIGHTS.—At any time a consumer is
required to receive a summary of rights required under section
609, the following notice shall be included:

““CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN A SECURITY FREEZE

“You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit
report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from
releasing information in your credit report without your express
authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit,
loans, and services from being approved in your name without
your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security
freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and
financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere
with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request
or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage,
or any other account involving the extension of credit.

““As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right
to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at
no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed
on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display
on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps
to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If
you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended
fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.

““A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or
its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person
or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests
information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing
or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities
related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases,
and account upgrades and enhancements.’.

“(6) WEBPAGE.—

“(A) CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES.—A consumer
reporting agency shall establish a webpage that—

“i) allows a consumer to request a security freeze;

“Gi) allows a consumer to request an initial fraud
alert;

“Gii) allows a consumer to request an extended
fraud alert;

“(iv) allows a consumer to request an active duty
fraud alert;

“(v) allows a consumer to opt-out of the use of
information in a consumer report to send the consumer

a solicitation of credit or insurance, in accordance with

section 615(d); and

“(vi) shall not be the only mechanism by which

a consumer may request a security freeze.

lish a single webpage that includes a link to each webpage
