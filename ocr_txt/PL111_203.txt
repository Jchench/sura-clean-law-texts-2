from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activi-
ties, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board
of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to recommendations
by the Council under section 115, establish prudential stand-
ards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board
of Governors and bank holding companies with total consoli-
dated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 that—

(A) are more stringent than the standards and require-
ments applicable to nonbank financial companies and bank
holding companies that do not present similar risks to
the financial stability of the United States; and

(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations
identified in subsection (b)(3).

(2) TAILORED APPLICATION.—

(A) IN GENERAL.—In prescribing more _ stringent
prudential standards under this section, the Board of Gov-
ernors may, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation
by the Council in accordance with section 115, differentiate
among companies on an individual basis or by category,

124 STAT. 1424

PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010

complexity, financial activities (including the financial

activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-

related factors that the Board of Governors deems appro-
priate.

CERTAIN STANDARDS.—The Board of Governors may, pursu-
ant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance
with section 115, establish an asset threshold above

(1) IN GENERAL.—

(A) REQUIRED STANDARDS.—The Board of Governors
shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial
companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank
holding companies described in subsection (a), that shall
include—

(i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage
limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation
with the Council, determines that such requirements
are not appropriate for a company subject to more
stringent prudential standards because of the activities
of such company (such as investment company activi-
ties or assets under management) or structure, in
which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other
standards that result in similarly stringent risk con-
trols;

(ii) liquidity requirements;

(iii) overall risk management requirements;

(iv) resolution plan and credit exposure report
requirements; and

(v) concentration limits.

(B) ADDITIONAL STANDARDS AUTHORIZED.—The Board
of Governors may establish additional prudential standards
for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board
of Governors and bank holding companies described in

or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a recommenda-
tion made by the Council in accordance with section
115, determines are appropriate.

(2) STANDARDS FOR FOREIGN FINANCIAL COMPANIES.—In
applying the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign
nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Gov-
ernors or foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of
Governors shall—

(A) give due regard to the principle of national treat-
ment and equality of competitive opportunity; and

(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign
financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to
home country standards that are comparable to those
applied to financial companies in the United States.

(3) CONSIDERATIONS.—In prescribing prudential standards
under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall—
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 1425

(ii) whether the company owns an insured deposi-
tory institution;

(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the
company; and

(iv) any other risk-related factors that the Board
of Governors determines appropriate;

in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section
113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in
the prudential standards established under paragraph (1)
of this subsection;

(C) take into account any recommendations of the
Council under section 115; and

(D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in
light of any predominant line of business of such company,

(4) CONSULTATION.—Before imposing prudential standards
or any other requirements pursuant to this section, including
notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent
requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices,
that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally
regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a

of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may

parent company or affiliates that are not subsidiaries of such
company, except that such regulations shall not restrict or
limit any transaction in connection with the bona fide acquisi-

REGARDING EXEMPTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SWAPS
AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS FROM DEFINITION
OF THE TERM ‘SWAP’.

“(a) REQUIRED CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining whether to
exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from
the definition of the term ‘swap’, the Secretary of the Treasury
(referred to in this section as the ‘Secretary’) shall consider—

“(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign
exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create
systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial
stability of the United States;

“(2) whether foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange
forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is
materially comparable to that established by this Act for other
classes of swaps;

“(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants
in the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision,
including capital and margin requirements;

“(4) the extent of adequate payment and settlement sys-
tems; and
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 1675

“(5) the use of a potential exemption of foreign exchange
swaps and foreign exchange forwards to evade otherwise
applicable regulatory requirements.

“(b) DETERMINATION.—If the Secretary makes a determination
to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards
from the definition of the term ‘swap’, the Secretary shall submit
to the appropriate committees of Congress a determination that
contains—

“(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps
and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from
other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign
exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for
regulation as swaps; and

“(2) an identification of the objective differences of foreign
exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with respect
to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.

“(c) EFFECT OF DETERMINATION.—A determination by the Sec-
retary under subsection (b) shall not exempt any foreign exchange
swaps and foreign exchange forwards traded on a designated con-
tract market or swap execution facility from any applicable anti-
fraud and antimanipulation provision under this title.”.

at a registered derivatives clearing organization and
which are reported to a swap data repository or the
Commission under subsection (h)(6), the Commission
shall require real-time public reporting for such trans-
actions, in a manner that does not disclose the business

trade) for particular markets and contracts;

reporting large notional swap transactions (block
trades) to the public; and

“iv) that take into account whether the public
disclosure will materially reduce market liquidity.

(including agents of the parties to a swap) shall be respon-
sible for reporting swap transaction information to the

be prescribed by the Commission.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 780) is amended
by adding at the end the following:

“(k) STANDARD OF CONDUCT.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commis-
sion may promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to
a broker or dealer, when providing personalized investment
advice about securities to a retail customer (and such other
customers as the Commission may by rule provide), the
standard of conduct for such broker or dealer with respect
to such customer shall be the same as the standard of conduct
applicable to an investment adviser under section 211 of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The receipt of compensation
based on commission or other standard compensation for the
sale of securities shall not, in and of itself, be considered
a violation of such standard applied to a broker or dealer.
Nothing in this section shall require a broker or dealer or
registered representative to have a continuing duty of care
or loyalty to the customer after providing personalized invest-
ment advice about securities.

“(2) DISCLOSURE OF RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED.—Where
a broker or dealer sells only proprietary or other limited range
of products, as determined by the Commission, the Commission
may by rule require that such broker or dealer provide notice
to each retail customer and obtain the consent or acknowledg-
ment of the customer. The sale of only proprietary or other
limited range of products by a broker or dealer shall not,
in and of itself, be considered a violation of the standard set
forth in paragraph (1).

“(1) OTHER MATTERS.—The Commission shall—

“(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures
to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with
brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any mate-
rial conflicts of interest; and

“(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules
prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of
interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and
investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to
the public interest and the protection of investors.”.

(2) INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940.—Section 211 of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is further amended by adding
at the end the following new subsections:

“(g) STANDARD OF CONDUCT.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission may promulgate rules
to provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers,
and investment advisers, when providing personalized invest-
ment advice about securities to retail customers (and such
other customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall
be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard
to the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or invest-
ment adviser providing the advice. In accordance with such
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 1829

rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and

may be consented to by the customer. Such rules shall provide

that such standard of conduct shall be no less stringent than
the standard applicable to investment advisers under section

206(1) and (2) of this Act when providing personalized invest-

ment advice about securities, except the Commission shall not

ascribe a meaning to the term ‘customer’ that would include
an investor in a private fund managed by an investment
adviser, where such private fund has entered into an advisory
contract with such adviser. The receipt of compensation based
on commission or fees shall not, in and of itself, be considered

a violation of such standard applied to a broker, dealer, or

investment adviser.

“(2) RETAIL CUSTOMER DEFINED.—For purposes of this sub-
section, the term ‘retail customer’ means a natural person,
or the legal representative of such natural person, who—

“(A) receives personalized investment advice about
securities from a broker, dealer, or investment adviser;
and

“(B) uses such advice primarily for personal, family,
or household purposes.

“ch) OTHER MATTERS.—The Commission shall—

“(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear disclosures
to investors regarding the terms of their relationships with
brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, including any mate-
rial conflicts of interest; and

“(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules
prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of
interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and
investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to
the public interest and the protection of investors.”.

“(m) HARMONIZATION OF ENFORCEMENT.—The enforcement
authority of the Commission with respect to violations of the
standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer
shall include—

“(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with
respect to such violations provided under this Act; and

“(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with
respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to
an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, including the authority to impose sanctions for such
violations, and

the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of
the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer
under this Act to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and
sanctions violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an
investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.”.

tions for such violations, and
the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of

violators of the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer
providing personalized investment advice about securities to a retail
customer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”.

ACTION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Securities and Exchange Commission Public comment.
of the United States shall solicit public comment and thereafter
conduct a study to determine the extent to which private rights
of action under the antifraud provisions of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-4) should be extended to
cover—

(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes a
significant step in the furtherance of the violation, even if

involves only foreign investors; and

(2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has
a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.

(b) CONTENTS.—The study shall consider and analyze, among
other things—

(1) the scope of such a private right of action, including
whether it should extend to all private actors or whether it
should be more limited to extend just to institutional investors
or otherwise;

(2) what implications such a private right of action would
have on international comity;

(3) the economic costs and benefits of extending a private
right of action for transnational securities frauds; and

(4) whether a narrower extraterritorial standard should
be adopted.

(c) REPORT.—A report of the study shall be submitted and
recommendations made to the Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial
Services of the House not later than 18 months after the date
of enactment of this Act.

ties Litigation Act of 1995.

(b) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to Con-
gress on the findings of the study required under subsection (a).

Subtitle C—Improvements to the
Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies

15 USC 780-7 SEC. 931. FINDINGS.
note.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings
and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and
institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities
and performances of credit rating agencies, including nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations, are matters of
national public interest, as credit rating agencies are central
to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient
performance of the United States economy.

(2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations, play a critical “gatekeeper” role
in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of securi-
ties analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in the
equity market, and auditors, who review the financial state-
ments of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public
oversight and accountability.

(3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and
analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other financial
“gatekeepers” do, the activities of credit rating agencies are
fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject
to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to
auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers.

(4) In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers
of structured financial products on potential ratings of such
products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of interest that
need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be
addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give clearer
authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured
financial products have proven to be inaccurate. This inaccuracy
contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by
financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely
impacted the health of the economy in the United States and
around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates increased
accountability on the part of credit rating agencies.

States; and
“(B) any Federal branch established in accordance with
the International Banking Act of 1978.
“(2) STATE CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS.—The term ‘State
consumer financial law’ means a State law that does not directly
or indirectly discriminate against national banks and that
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 2015

directly and specifically regulates the manner, content, or terms
and conditions of any financial transaction (as may be author-
ized for national banks to engage in), or any account related
thereto, with respect to a consumer.

“(3) OTHER DEFINITIONS.—The terms ‘affiliate’, ‘subsidiary’,
‘includes’, and ‘including’ have the same meanings as in section
3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

“(b) PREEMPTION STANDARD.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—State consumer financial laws are pre-
empted, only if—

“(A) application of a State consumer financial law
would have a discriminatory effect on national banks, in
comparison with the effect of the law on a bank chartered
by that State;

“(B) in accordance with the legal standard for preemp-
tion in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N. A. v. Nelson,
Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25 (1996),
the State consumer financial law prevents or significantly
interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its
powers; and any preemption determination under this
subparagraph may be made by a court, or by regulation
or order of the Comptroller of the Currency on a case-
by-case basis, in accordance with applicable law; or

“(C) the State consumer financial law is preempted
by a provision of Federal law other than this title.

“(2) SAVINGS CLAUSE.—This title and section 24 of the
Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371) do not preempt, annul,
or affect the applicability of any State law to any subsidiary
or affiliate of a national bank (other than a subsidiary or
affiliate that is chartered as a national bank).

“(3) CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.—

“(A) DEFINITION.—As used in this section the term
‘case-by-case basis’ refers to a determination pursuant to
this section made by the Comptroller concerning the impact
of a particular State consumer financial law on any national
bank that is subject to that law, or the law of any other
State with substantively equivalent terms.

“(B) CONSULTATION.—When making a determination
on a case-by-case basis that a State consumer financial
law of another State has substantively equivalent terms
as one that the Comptroller is preempting, the Comptroller
shall first consult with the Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection and shall take the views of the Bureau into
account when making the determination.

“(4) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—This title does not occupy
the field in any area of State law.

“(5) STANDARDS OF REVIEW.—

“(A) PREEMPTION.—A court reviewing any determina-
tions made by the Comptroller regarding preemption of
a State law by this title or section 24 of the Federal
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371) shall assess the validity of
such determinations, depending upon the thoroughness evi-
dent in the consideration of the agency, the validity of
the reasoning of the agency, the consistency with other
valid determinations made by the agency, and other factors

which the court finds persuasive and relevant to its deci-

sion.

or other Federal laws.

regulation, order, or determination made by the Comptroller
of the Currency under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made by the
Comptroller, and shall not be delegable to another officer or
employee of the Comptroller of the Currency.

“(c) SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.—No regulation or order of the
Comptroller of the Currency prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(B),
shall be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise
declare inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State
consumer financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the
record of the proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding
the preemption of such provision in accordance with the legal
standard of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insur-
ance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25 (1996).

“(d) PERIODIC REVIEW OF PREEMPTION DETERMINATIONS.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—The Comptroller of the Currency shall
periodically conduct a review, through notice and public com-
ment, of each determination that a provision of Federal law
preempts a State consumer financial law. The agency shall
conduct such review within the 5-year period after prescribing
or otherwise issuing such determination, and at least once
during each 5-year period thereafter. After conducting the
review of, and inspecting the comments made on, the deter-
mination, the agency shall publish a notice in the Federal
Register announcing the decision to continue or rescind the
determination or a proposal to amend the determination. Any
such notice of a proposal to amend a determination and the
subsequent resolution of such proposal shall comply with the
procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5244
ia 1) Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 43

conducted under paragraph (1), the Comptroller of the Currency
shall submit a report regarding such review to the Committee
on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and

shall address whether the agency intends to continue, rescind,
or propose to amend any determination that a provision of
Federal law preempts a State consumer financial law, and
the reasons therefor.

“(e) APPLICATION OF STATE CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAW TO
SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES.—Notwithstanding any provision of
this title or section 24 of Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371),
a State consumer financial law shall apply to a subsidiary or
affiliate of a national bank (other than a subsidiary or affiliate
that is chartered as a national bank) to the same extent that
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 2017

the State consumer financial law applies to any person, corporation,
or other entity subject to such State law.

“(f) PRESERVATION OF POWERS RELATED TO CHARGING
INTEREST.—No provision of this title shall be construed as altering
or otherwise affecting the authority conferred by section 5197 of
the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 85) for the
charging of interest by a national bank at the rate allowed by
the laws of the State, territory, or district where the bank is
located, including with respect to the meaning of ‘interest’ under
such provision.

“(a) ABILITY TO REPAY.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—In accordance with regulations pre-
scribed by the Board, no creditor may make a residential mort-
gage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good
faith determination based on verified and documented informa-
tion that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer
has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its
terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage
guarantee insurance), and assessments.

“(2) MULTIPLE LOANS.—If the creditor knows, or has reason
to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 2143

by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer,
the creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determina-
tion, based on verified and documented information, that the
consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the combined pay-
ments of all loans on the same dwelling according to the terms
of those loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including
mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.

“(3) BASIS FOR DETERMINATION.—A determination under
this subsection of a consumer’s ability to repay a residential
mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer’s
credit history, current income, expected income the consumer
is reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-
to-income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have
after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obliga-
tions, employment status, and other financial resources other
than the consumer’s equity in the dwelling or real property
that secures repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine
the ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule
that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.

“(4) INCOME VERIFICATION.—A creditor making a residential
mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that
such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including
expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer’s Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, finan-
cial institution records, or other third-party documents that
provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer’s income
or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent reporting,
any consideration of a consumer’s income history in making
a determination under this subsection shall include the
verification of such income by the use of—

“(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax
returns; or

“(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies
income documentation by a third party subject to rules
prescribed by the Board.

“(5) EXEMPTION.—With respect to loans made, guaranteed,
or insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in
subsection (b)(3)(B)(i), such departments or agencies may
exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this
income verification requirement as long as the following condi-
tions are met:

“(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due
on the prior existing residential mortgage loan.

“(B) The refinancing does not increase the principal
balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mort-
gage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed
by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or
insuring the refinancing.

“(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section
103(aa)(4), other than bona fide third party charges not
retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate
of the creditor or mortgage originator) payable in connec-
tion with the refinancing do not exceed 3 percent of the
total new loan amount.

“(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower
than the interest rate of the original loan, unless the bor-
rower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-
124 STAT. 2144

Regulations.

PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010

rate loan, under guidelines that the department or agency
shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue.

“(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule
that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with
the regulations prescribed by the department or agency
making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.

“(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in
a balloon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).

“(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being
refinanced and the refinancing satisfy all requirements
of the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or
insuring the refinancing.

“(6) NONSTANDARD LOANS.—

“(A) VARIABLE RATE LOANS THAT DEFER REPAYMENT
OF ANY PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST.—For purposes of deter-
mining, under this subsection, a consumer’s ability to repay
a variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or
requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any prin-
cipal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing
repayment schedule.

“(B) INTEREST-ONLY LOANS.—For purposes of deter-
mining, under this subsection, a consumer’s ability to repay
a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires the
payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the payment
amount required to amortize the loan by its final maturity.

“(C) CALCULATION FOR NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION.—In
making any determination under this subsection, a creditor
shall also take into consideration any balance increase
that may accrue from any negative amortization provision.

“(D) CALCULATION PROCESS.—For purposes of making
any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall
calculate the monthly payment amount for principal and
interest on any residential mortgage loan by assuming—

“i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on the
date of the consummation of the loan;

“(i) the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal
monthly amortizing payments for principal and
interest over the entire term of the loan with no balloon
payment, unless the loan contract requires more rapid
repayment (including balloon payment), in which case
the calculation shall be made (I) in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Board, with respect to
any loan which has an annual percentage rate that
does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a
comparable transaction, as of the date the interest
rate is set, by 1.5 or more percentage points for a
first lien residential mortgage loan; and by 3.5 or more
percentage points for a subordinate lien residential
mortgage loan; or (II) using the contract’s repayment
schedule, with respect to a loan which has an annual
percentage rate, as of the date the interest rate is
set, that is at least 1.5 percentage points above the
average prime offer rate for a first lien residential
mortgage loan; and 3.5 percentage points above the
average prime offer rate for a subordinate lien residen-
tial mortgage loan; and
PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010 124 STAT. 2145

“Gii) the interest rate over the entire term of the
loan is a fixed rate equal to the fully indexed rate
at the time of the loan closing, without considering
the introductory rate.

“(E) REFINANCE OF HYBRID LOANS WITH CURRENT
LENDER.—In considering any application for refinancing
an existing hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard
loan to be made by the same creditor in any case in
which there would be a reduction in monthly payment
and the mortgagor has not been delinquent on any payment
on the existing hybrid loan, the creditor may—

“(i) consider the mortgagor’s good standing on the
existing mortgage;

“Gi) consider if the extension of new credit would
prevent a likely default should the original mortgage
reset and give such concerns a higher priority as an
acceptable underwriting practice; and

“ii) offer rate discounts and other favorable terms
to such mortgagor that would be available to new
customers with high credit ratings based on such
underwriting practice.

“(7) FULLY-INDEXED RATE DEFINED.—For purposes of this
subsection, the term ‘fully indexed rate’ means the index rate
prevailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan
is made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration
of any introductory interest rates.

“(8) REVERSE MORTGAGES AND BRIDGE LOANS.—This sub-
section shall not apply with respect to any reverse mortgage
or temporary or bridge loan with a term of 12 months or
less, including to any loan to purchase a new dwelling where
the consumer plans to sell a different dwelling within 12
months.

“(9) SEASONAL INCOME.—If documented income, including
income from a small business, is a repayment source for a
residential mortgage loan, a creditor may consider the
seasonality and irregularity of such income in the underwriting
of and scheduling of payments for such credit.”.

Subtitle H—Miscellaneous Provisions

SEC. 1491. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM TO
ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND REGULA-
TION OF THE TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE
CREDIT.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:

(1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were char-
tered by Congress to ensure a reliable and affordable supply
of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual legal status as privately
owned corporations with Government mandated affordable
housing goals.

(2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie
Mac’s mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income
levels below the median for a given area.

(3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of
their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally
mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac be “special affordable” loans made to
borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an area’s
median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent
for 2008.

(4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals,
in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development
authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime
securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.

(5) After this authorization to purchase subprime securities,
subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 percent of
securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while
the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8
percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding
increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 percent to
32.7 percent over the same period.

(6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased
$175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which
accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from
2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased
approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans,
while Fannie Mae’s acquisitions of mortgages with less than
10 percent down payments almost tripled.

(7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly
originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cur-
rently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the
United States and have issued mortgage-backed securities for
31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total
ot 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United

tates.

(8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury
124 STAT. 2206 PUBLIC LAW 111-203—JULY 21, 2010

Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least

$200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in

exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of
each enterprise’s common stock.

(9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards’ of
$5,300,000,000,000 worth of risk.

(10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that
consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans
on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the
loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive,
or abusive.

(b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the Congress
that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation
of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related
to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful
structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
