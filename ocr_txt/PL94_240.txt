FINDINGS AND PURPOSE ee 1601

Sec. 2. Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601)
is amended by inserting “(a)” before the first sentence, and adding
the following subsection :

“(b) The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend
toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use
as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have
been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the | gat tay of this
title to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of per-
sonal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to
enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms avail-
able to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable com-
parison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to
assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in
advertisements.”.

*{ A brief description or identification of the leased property ;

and that the lessee shall be liable for the differential, if any,
between the anticipated fair market value of the leased property
and its appraised actual value at the termination of the lease, if
the lessee has such liability ;

“(5) A statement of the amount or method of determining the
amount of any liabilities the lease imposes upon the lessee at the
end of the term and whether or not the lessee has the option to

“(11) A statement of the conditions under which the lessee or
lessor may terminate the lease prior to the end of the term and

contract to be signed by the lessee. The Board may provide by regula-
tion that any portion of the information required to be disclosed under
PUBLIC LAW 94-240—MAR. 23, 1976

this section may be given in the form of estimates where the lessor is
not in a position to know exact information.

“§ 183. Lessee’s liability on expiration or termination of lease

“(a) Where the lessee’s liability on expiration of a consumer lease
is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated
residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated
actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There
shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is
unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds
the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment
allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, hoes the
lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall
be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor’s estimated residual value
is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value
exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average
payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor
shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on
expiration of a conswner lease unless the Jessor brings a successful
action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor
shall pay the lessee’s reasonable attorney’s fees. The presumptions
stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of esti-
mated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the
property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and
the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards
are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the
right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjust-
ment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an
agreement is reached after termination of the lease,

“(b) Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or earl
termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount whic
is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by
the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof
of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining
an adequate remedy.

“(c) If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of
the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal
of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by
both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.

“§ 184. Consumer lease advertising

“(a) No advertisement to aid, promote, or assist directly or indi-
rectly any consumer lease shall state the amount of any payment, the
number of required payments, or that any or no downpayment or
other payment is required at inception of the lease unless the adver-
tisement also states clearly and conspicuously and in accordance with
regulations issued by the Board each of the following items of infor-
mation which is applicable:

“(1) That the transaction advertised is a lease.
* (2) The amount of any payment required at the inception of
the lease or that no such payment is required if that is the case.

“(3) The number, amounts, due dates or periods of scheduled
payments, and the total of payments under the lease.

“(4) That the lessee shall be liable for the differential, if any,
between the anticipated fair market value of the leased property
and its appraised actual value at the termination of the lease, if
the lames len such liability.

“(5) A statement of the amount or method of determining the
amount of any liabilities the lease imposes upon the lessee at the

urchase the leased property and at what price and time.

# (b) There is no liability under this section on the part of any
owner or personnel, as such, of any medium in which an advertisement
appears or through which it is disseminated. .

“§ 185. Civil liability

“(a) Any lessor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed
under section 182 or 183 of this chapter with respect to any person
is liable to such person as provided in section 130.

“(b) Any lessor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed
under section 184 of this chapter with respect to any person who suffers
actual damage from the violation is liable to such person as provided
in section 130. For the purposes of this section, the term ‘creditor’
as used in sections 115, 130, and 131 shall include a lessor as defined
in this chapter.

“(c) Notwithstanding section 130(e), any action under this section
may be brought in any United States district court or in any other
court of competent jurisdiction. Such actions alleging a failure to
disclose or otherwise comply with the requirements of this chapter
shall be brought within one year of the termination of the lease

agreement.
“§ 186. Relation to State laws

“(a) This chapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any
person subject to the provisions of this chapter from complying with,
the laws of any State with respect to consumer leases, except to the
extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this
chapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. The Board
is authorized to determine whether such inconsistencies exist. The
Board may not determine that any State law is inconsistent with any
provision of this chapter if the Board determines that such Jaw gives
greater protection and benefit to the consumer.

“(b) The Board shall by regulation exempt from the requirements
of this chapter any class of lease transactions within any State if it
determines that under the law of that State that class of transactions
is subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed under
this chapter or that such law gives greater protection and benefit to |
the consumer, and that there is adequate provision for enforcement.”
