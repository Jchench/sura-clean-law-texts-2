“(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), a finan-

any activity, that the Board, in accordance with paragraph
(2), determines (by regulation or order)—

“(2) COORDINATION BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE SEC-
RETARY OF THE TREASURY.—

“(A) PROPOSALS RAISED BEFORE THE BOARD.—

“(i) CONSULTATION.—The Board shall notify the

mination of whether an activity is financial in nature
or incidental to a financial activity.

“Gi) TREASURY VIEW.—The Board shall not deter-
mine that any activity is financial in nature or inci-
dental to a financial activity under this subsection
if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the Board
in writing, not later than 30 days after the date of
receipt of the notice described in clause (i) (or such
longer period as the Board determines to be appro-
priate under the circumstances) that the Secretary of

recommendation from the Secretary of the Treasury
under clause (i) (or such longer period as the Secretary
of the Treasury and the Board determine to be appro-
priate under the circumstances), the Board shall deter-
mine whether to initiate a public rulemaking proposing
that the recommended activity be found to be financial
in nature or incidental to a financial activity under
this subsection, and shall notify the Secretary of the

that are financial in nature through the use of techno-
logical means, including any application necessary to

lation, unless modified by the Board).

that—

holding company under subsection (1)(1).

“(3) BOARD MAY IMPOSE LIMITATIONS.—Until the conditions
described in a notice to a financial holding company under

“(4) FAILURE TO CORRECT.—If the conditions described in
a notice to a financial holding company under paragraph (1)

institution; or

“(B) at the election of the financial holding company
instead to cease to engage in any activity conducted by
such financial holding company or its subsidiaries (other
than a depository institution or a subsidiary of a depository
institution) that is not an activity that is permissible for

a bank holding company under subsection (c)(8).

section, the Board shall consult with all relevant Federal and
State regulatory agencies and authorities.

Act entitled “An Act to express the intent of Congress with reference
to the regulation of the business of insurance” and approved March
9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the
“McCarran-Ferguson Act”) remains the law of the United States.

(b) MANDATORY INSURANCE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.—No
person shall engage in the business of insurance in a State as
principal or agent unless such person is licensed as required by
the appropriate insurance regulator of such State in accordance
with the relevant State insurance law, subject to subsections (c),
(d), and (e).

(c) AFFILIATIONS.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), no
State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other
action, prevent or restrict a depository institution, or an affiliate
thereof, from being affiliated directly or indirectly or associated
with any person, as authorized or permitted by this Act or
any other provision of Federal law.

(2) INSURANCE.—With respect to affiliations between
depository institutions, or any affiliate thereof, and any insurer,
paragraph (1) does not prohibit—

(A) any State from—

Gi) collecting, reviewing, and taking actions

(including approval and disapproval) on applications

and other documents or reports concerning any pro-

posed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of
control of, an insurer domiciled in that State; and
(ii) exercising authority granted under applicable
State law to collect information concerning any pro-
posed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of
control of, an insurer engaged in the business of insur-
ance in, and regulated as an insurer by, such State;
during the 60-day period preceding the effective date of
the acquisition or change or continuation of control, so
long as the collecting, reviewing, taking actions, or exer-
cising authority by the State does not have the effect of

discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against a

depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or against

any other person based upon an association of such person
with a depository institution;

(B) any State from requiring any person that is
acquiring control of an insurer domiciled in that State
to maintain or restore the capital requirements of that
insurer to the level required under the capital regulations
of general applicability in that State to avoid the require-
ment of preparing and filing with the insurance regulatory
authority of that State a plan to increase the capital of
the insurer, except that any determination by the State
insurance regulatory authority with respect to such require-
ment shall be made not later than 60 days after the date
of notification under subparagraph (A); or

(C) any State from restricting a change in the owner-
ship of stock in an insurer, or a company formed for the
purpose of controlling such insurer, after the conversion
of the insurer from mutual to stock form so long as such
PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999 113 STAT. 1353

restriction does not have the effect of discriminating, inten-

tionally or unintentionally, against a depository institution

or an affiliate thereof, or against any other person based
upon an association of such person with a depository
institution.

(d) ACTIVITIES.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (3), and

either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate, or any other
person, in any activity authorized or permitted under this Act
and the amendments made by this Act.

by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action,
prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of a
depository institution, or an affiliate thereof, to engage,
directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction
with an affiliate or any other person, in any insurance
sales, solicitation, or crossmarketing activity.

(B) CERTAIN STATE LAWS PRESERVED.—Notwith-
standing subparagraph (A), a State may impose any of
the following restrictions, or restrictions that are substan-
tially the same as but no more burdensome or restrictive
than those in each of the following clauses:

(i) Restrictions prohibiting the rejection of an
insurance policy by a depository institution or an affil-
iate of a depository institution, solely because the policy
has been issued or underwritten by any person who
is not associated with such depository institution or
affiliate when the insurance is required in connection
with a loan or extension of credit.

(ii) Restrictions prohibiting a requirement for any
debtor, insurer, or insurance agent or broker to pay
a separate charge in connection with the handling
of insurance that is required in connection with a
loan or other extension of credit or the provision of
another traditional banking product by a depository
institution, or any affiliate of a depository institution,
unless such charge would be required when the deposi-
tory institution or affiliate is the licensed insurance
agent or broker providing the insurance.

(iii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of any
advertisement or other insurance promotional material
by a depository institution or any affiliate of a deposi-
tory institution that would cause a reasonable person
to believe mistakenly that—

(I) the Federal Government or a State is
responsible for the insurance sales activities of,
or stands behind the credit of, the institution or
affiliate; or
113 STAT. 1354

PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999

guarantees any returns on insurance products, or
is a source of payment on any insurance obligation
of or sold by the institution or affiliate;

of any commission or brokerage fee or other valuable
consideration for services as an insurance agent or

performed, except that, in this clause, the term “serv-
ices as an insurance agent or broker” does not include

to or received by any individual who is not licensed
to sell insurance, for the referral of a customer that

chase of insurance by the customer.

(vi) Restrictions prohibiting the release of the
insurance information of a customer (defined as
information concerning the premiums, terms, and
conditions of insurance coverage, including expiration
dates and rates, and insurance claims of a customer
contained in the records of the depository institution
or an affiliate thereof) to any person other than an
officer, director, employee, agent, or affiliate of a
depository institution, for the purpose of soliciting or
selling insurance, without the express consent of the
customer, other than a provision that prohibits—

(I) a transfer of insurance information to an
unaffiliated insurer in connection with transferring
insurance in force on existing insureds of the
depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or
in connection with a merger with or acquisition
of an unaffiliated insurer; or

authorized by State or Federal law.

(vii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of health
information obtained from the insurance records of
a customer for any purpose, other than for its activities

credit or any product or service that is equivalent
to an extension of credit, lease or sale of property
of any kind, or furnishing of any services or fixing
or varying the consideration for any of the foregoing,
on the condition or requirement that the customer
obtain insurance from a depository institution or an
affiliate of a depository institution, or a particular
insurer, agent, or broker, other than a prohibition that
PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999 113 STAT. 1355

would prevent any such depository institution or
affiliate—

(I) from engaging in any activity described
in this clause that would not violate section 106
of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments
of 1970, as interpreted by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System; or

(II) from informing a customer or prospective
customer that insurance is required in order to
obtain a loan or credit, that loan or credit approval
is contingent upon the procurement by the cus-
tomer of acceptable insurance, or that insurance
is available from the depository institution or an
affiliate of the depository institution.

(ix) Restrictions requiring, when an application by
a consumer for a loan or other extension of credit
from a depository institution is pending, and insurance
is offered or sold to the consumer or is required in
connection with the loan or extension of credit by the
depository institution or any affiliate thereof, that a
written disclosure be provided to the consumer or
prospective customer indicating that the customer’s
choice of an insurance provider will not affect the
credit decision or credit terms in any way, except that
the depository institution may impose reasonable
requirements concerning the creditworthiness of the
insurer and scope of coverage chosen.

(x) Restrictions requiring clear and conspicuous
disclosure, in writing, where practicable, to the cus-
tomer prior to the sale of any insurance policy that
such policy—

iting the purchase of or selling insurance on the prem-
ises thereof, the credit and insurance transactions be
completed through separate documents.

(xii) Restrictions prohibiting, when a customer
obtains insurance (other than credit insurance or flood
insurance) and credit from a depository institution or
an affiliate of such institution, or any person soliciting
the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises
thereof, inclusion of the expense of insurance premiums
in the primary credit transaction without the express
written consent of the customer.

insurance as agent in such State.

and (3) and notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a national

provided, or sold in such State, or from being underwritten with
respect to real property in such State, by any person whatsoever.

SEC. 306. CERTAIN STATE AFFILIATION LAWS PREEMPTED FOR 15 USC 6715.
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND AFFILIATES.

Except as provided in section 104(c)(2), no State may, by law,
regulation, order, interpretation, or otherwise—

(1) prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of
any insurer, or any affiliate of an insurer (whether such affiliate
is organized as a stock company, mutual holding company,
or otherwise), to become a financial holding company or to
acquire control of a depository institution;

invested in the voting securities of a depository institution
(or any company which controls such institution), except that

of such investment to an amount that is not less than 5 percent
of the insurer’s admitted assets; or

SEC. 307. INTERAGENCY CONSULTATION. 15 USC 6716.

(a) PURPOSE.—It is the intention of the Congress that the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the umbrella
supervisor for financial holding companies, and the State insurance
regulators, as the functional regulators of companies engaged in
insurance activities, coordinate efforts to supervise companies that
control both a depository institution and a company engaged in
insurance activities regulated under State law. In particular, Con-
gress believes that the Board and the State insurance regulators
should share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the
supervision of companies that control both a depository institution
and a company engaged in insurance activities, including informa-
tion regarding the financial health of the consolidated organization
and information regarding transactions and relationships between
insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. The
appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository institutions
should also share, on a confidential basis, information with the
relevant State insurance regulators regarding transactions and rela-
tionships between depository institutions and affiliated companies
engaged in insurance activities. The purpose of this section is to
encourage this coordination and confidential sharing of information,
and to thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the
supervision of financial holding companies and their affiliated
depository institutions and companies engaged in insurance activi-
ties.

(b) EXAMINATION RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATION.—

(1) INFORMATION OF THE BOARD.—Upon the request of the
appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may
provide any information of the Board regarding the financial
condition, risk management policies, and operations of any
financial holding company that controls a company that is
engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such State
113 STAT. 1416 PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999

insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or relation-

ship between such an insurance company and any affiliated

depository institution. The Board may provide any other
information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that
the Board believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the

State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable

State insurance laws.

(2) BANKING AGENCY INFORMATION.—Upon the request of
the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appro-
priate Federal banking agency may provide any information
of the agency regarding any transaction or relationship between
a depository institution supervised by such Federal banking
agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in insurance
activities regulated by such State insurance regulator. The
appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any other
information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that
the agency believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the
State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable
State insurance laws.

(3) STATE INSURANCE REGULATOR INFORMATION.—Upon the
request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency,
a State insurance regulator may provide any examination or
other reports, records, or other information to which such insur-
ance, regulator may have access with respect to a company
which—

(A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated
by such insurance regulator; and

(B) is an affiliate of a depository institution or financial
holding company.

(c) CONSULTATION.—Before making any determination relating
to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation of, a deposi-
tory institution or financial holding company with a company
engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal banking
agency shall consult with the appropriate State insurance regulator
of such company and take the views of such insurance regulator
into account in making such determination.

(d) EFFECT ON OTHER AUTHORITY.—Nothing in this section
shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate Federal
banking agency with respect to a depository institution or bank
holding company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of
law.

(e) CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVILEGE.—

(1) CONFIDENTIALITY.—The appropriate Federal banking
agency shall not provide any information or material that is
entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal
banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a State
insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to maintain
the information or material in confidence and to take all reason-
able steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the
information or material by the regulator. The appropriate Fed-
eral banking agency shall treat as confidential any information
or material obtained from a State insurance regulator that
is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable State
regulations, or other applicable law, and take all reasonable
steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information
or material by the Federal banking agency.
PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999 113 STAT. 1417

SEC. 312. REDOMESTICATION OF MUTUAL INSURERS. 15 USC 6732.

(a) REDOMESTICATION.—A mutual insurer organized under the
laws of any State may transfer its domicile to a transferee domicile

the transferee domicile and consistent with the standards in sub-
section (f), the mutual insurer becomes a stock insurer that is
a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual holding company.

(b) RESULTING DOMICILE.—Upon complying with the applicable
law of the transferee domicile governing transfers of domicile and

insurer of the transferee domicile.

(c) LICENSES PRESERVED.—The certificate of authority, agents’
appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other items that
a licensed State allows and that are in existence immediately prior
to the date that a redomesticating insurer transfers its domicile

upon transfer, if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact
the business of insurance in such licensed State.

(d) EFFECTIVENESS OF OUTSTANDING POLICIES AND CON-
TRACTS.—
113 STAT. 1418

PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999

annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain
in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the
new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State
insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the
case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners reside
in such licensed State.

(2) FORMS.—

(A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating
insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance
regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective
date of the transfer.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomes-
ticating insurer may use existing policy forms with appro-
priate endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the
redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are
approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such
licensed State.

(e) NoTICE.—A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of the

proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of each licensed
State and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate
documents required to be filed by a foreign licensed mutual insurer
with the insurance regulator of each such licensed State.

(f) PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS.—No mutual insurer may re-

domesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual holding
company pursuant to this section unless the State insurance regu-
lator of the transferee domicile determines that the plan of reorga-
nization of the insurer includes the following requirements:

(1) APPROVAL BY BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND POLICY-
HOLDERS.—The reorganization is approved by at least a
majority of the board of directors of the mutual insurer and
at least a majority of the policyholders who vote after notice,
disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the trans-
action on policyholder contractual rights, and reasonable oppor-
tunity to vote, in accordance with such notice, disclosure, and
voting procedures as are approved by the State insurance regu-
lator of the transferee domicile.

(2) CONTINUED VOTING CONTROL BY POLICYHOLDERS; REVIEW
OF PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING.—After the consummation of a
reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer
shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual
holding company as they had before the reorganization with
respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial public
offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in compliance
with applicable securities laws and in a manner approved by
the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.

(3) AWARD OF STOCK OR GRANT OF OPTIONS TO OFFICERS
AND DIRECTORS.—During the applicable period provided for
under the State law of the transferee domicile following comple-
tion of an initial public offering, or for a period of six months
if no such applicable period is provided, neither a stock holding
company nor the converted insurer shall award any stock
options or stock grants to persons who are elected officers
or directors of the mutual holding company, the stock holding
company, or the converted insurer, except with respect to any
such awards or options to which a person is entitled as a
PUBLIC LAW 106—102—NOV. 12, 1999 113 STAT. 1419

policyholder and as approved by the State insurance regulator
of the transferee domicile.

(4) POLICYHOLDER RIGHTS.—Upon reorganization into a
mutual holding company, the contractual rights of the policy-
holders are preserved.

(5) FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF POLICYHOLDERS.—
The reorganization is approved as fair and equitable to the
policyholders by the insurance regulator of the transferee
domicile.

to—

(1) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding
the activities of, taking any action against, or applying any
provision of law or regulation to, any insurer or an affiliate
of such insurer because that insurer or any affiliate plans
to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this sub-
title;

(2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding
the activities of, taking action against, or applying any provision
of law or regulation to, any insured or any insurance licensee
or other intermediary because such person has procured insur-
ance from or placed insurance with any insurer or affiliate
of such insurer that plans to redomesticate, or has redomes-
ticated, pursuant to this subtitle, but only to the extent that
such law would treat such insured licensee or other inter-
mediary differently than if the person procured insurance from,
or placed insurance with, an insured licensee or other inter-
mediary which had not redomesticated; and

(3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating,
because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant
to this subtitle, any certificate of authority, agent appointment
or license, rate approval, or other approval, of any State insur-
ance regulator or other State authority in existence immediately
prior to the redomestication in any State other than the trans-
feree domicile.

(b) DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT PROHIBITED.—No State law, regu-
lation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, of a State
other than a transferee domicile may treat a redomesticating or
redomesticated insurer or any affiliate thereof any differently than
an insurer operating in that State that is not a redomesticating
or redomesticated insurer.

(c) LAWS PROHIBITING OPERATIONS.—If any licensed State fails
to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an original
or renewal certificate of authority of a redomesticated insurer
promptly following redomestication, except on grounds and in a
manner consistent with its past practices regarding the issuance
of certificates of authority to foreign insurers that are not redomes-
ticating, then the redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from
any State law of the licensed State to the extent that such State
law or the operation of such State law would make unlawful,
or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomes-
ticated insurer, except that such licensed State may require the
redomesticated insurer to—

home State also awards such licenses on such a reciprocal
basis, without satisfying any additional requirements other
