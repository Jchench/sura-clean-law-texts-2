fied loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection

the average market yield on outstanding marketable obliga-
tions of the United States with remaining periods to matu-
rity equal to 12 months.

“(3) REPAYMENT SCHEDULE.—The Stabilization Fund shall
repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest
on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the
Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not later
than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first advance
to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends this final
repayment date. The Board shall obtain the concurrence of
the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed extension,
including the terms and conditions of the extended repayment.
“(d) ASSESSMENT TO REPAY ADVANCES.—At least 90 days prior

to each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall
PUBLIC LAW 111—-22—MAY 20, 2009 123 STAT. 1653

set the amount of the upcoming repayment and determine if the
Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repay-
ment. If the Stabilization Fund might not have sufficient funds
to make the repayment, the Board shall assess each federally
insured credit union a special premium due and payable within
60 days in an aggregate amount calculated to ensure the Stabiliza-
tion Fund is able to make the repayment. The premium charge
for each credit union shall be stated as a percentage of its insured
shares as represented on the credit union’s previous call report.
The percentage shall be identical for each credit union. Any credit
union that fails to make timely payment of the special premium
is subject to the procedures and penalties described under sub-
sections (d), (e), and (f) of section 202.

“Ce) DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INSURANCE FUND.—At the end of
any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an out-
standing advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohib-
ited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described
in section 202(c)(3). In lieu of the distribution described in that
section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Sta-
bilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not
reduce the Insurance Fund’s equity ratio below the normal oper-
ating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund’s available
assets ratio below 1.0 percent.

“(f) INVESTMENT OF STABILIZATION FUND ASSETS.—The Board
may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion
of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board’s judgment,
required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such
investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in
public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of
the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing
interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,
taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding
marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.

“(g) REPORTS.—The Board shall submit an annual report to
Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation
of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within
30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under
subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the
Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment
of borrowings to Treasury at the Board’s discretion not due until
7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses
of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund
may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments,
the Poard shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the
Fund.

“(h) CLOSING OF STABILIZATION FUND.—Within 90 days fol- Deadline.
lowing the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund
advance, or earlier at the Board’s discretion, the Board shall dis-
tribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Sta-
bilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabiliza-
tion Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as per- Extension.
mitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the
Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.”.

SEC. 1002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(1) a lack of affordable housing and limited scale of housing
assistance programs are the primary causes of homelessness;
an

(2) homelessness affects all types of communities in the
United States, including rural, urban, and suburban areas.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this division are—

(1) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance pro-
grams carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento Home-
less Assistance Act (consisting of the supportive housing pro-
gram and related innovative programs, the safe havens pro-
gram, the section 8 assistance program for single-room occu-
pancy dwellings, and the shelter plus care program) into a
single program with specific eligible activities;

(2) to codify in Federal law the continuum of care planning
process as a required and integral local function necessary
to generate the local strategies for ending homelessness; and

(3) to establish a Federal goal of ensuring that individuals
and families who become homeless return to permanent housing
within 30 days.
