“(1) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

“(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes

geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or
financial institutions.

“(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act
with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed
in a particular locality or are directed at a single institu-
tion, because modern financial systems and institutions
are interconnected to a degree which was not possible
until recently, money laundering and other related finan-
cial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and
international effects wherever they are committed.

“(2) PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE.—It is the purpose of this
section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where
money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be
occurring at a higher than average rate such that—

“(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such
crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with
State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes
the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity;
or

“(B) such area can be targeted for law enforcement
action.

“(b) ELEMENT OF NATIONAL STRATEGY.—The designation of cer-

tain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial
crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an

ing into consideration the factors specified in subsection (d),
shall designate any geographical area, industry, sector, or
institution in the United States in which money laundering

tial risk as a ‘high-risk money laundering and related financial
crimes area’.

“(2) CASE-BY-CASE DETERMINATION IN CONSULTATION WITH
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.—In addition to the factors specified
in subsection (d), any designation of any area under paragraph
(1) shall be made on the basis of a determination by the
Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the
particular area, industry, sector, or institution is being victim-
ized by, or is particularly vulnerable to, money laundering
and related financial crimes.

“(3) SPECIFIC INITIATIVES.—Any head of a department,
bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or
PUBLIC LAW 105-310—OCT. 30, 1998 112 STAT. 2945

local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and
suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes
and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit—
“(A) a written request for the designation of any area
as a high-risk money laundering and related financial
crimes area; or
“(B) a written request for funding under section 5351
for a specific prevention or enforcement initiative, or to
determine the extent of financial criminal activity, in an
area.

“(d) FacTors.—In considering the designation of any area as
a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area,
the Secretary shall, to the extent appropriate and in consultation
with the Attorney General, take into account the following factors:

“(1) The population of the area.

“(2) The number of bank and nonbank financial institution
transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions
located in such area.

or commerce.

“(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial
crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful
impact in other areas of the country.

“(7) The number or nature of requests for information
or analytical assistance which—

“(A) are made to the analytical component of the

Department of the Treasury; and

“(B) originate from law enforcement or regulatory
authorities located in such area or involve institutions or
businesses located in such area or residents of such area.

“(8) The volume or nature of suspicious activity reports
originating in the area.

“(9) The volume or nature of currency transaction reports
or reports of cross-border movements of currency or monetary
instruments originating in, or transported through, the area.

“(10) Whether, and how often, the area has been the subject
of a geographical targeting order.

“(11) Observed changes in trends and patterns of money
laundering activity.

“(12) Unusual patterns, anomalies, growth, or other
changes in the volume or nature of core economic statistics
or indicators.

“(13) Statistics or indicators of unusual or unexplained
volumes of cash transactions.

“(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the vol-
ume or nature of transactions conducted through financial
institutions operating within or outside the United States.

resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the
area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources
112 STAT. 2946 PUBLIC LAW 105-310—OCT. 30, 1998

reflects a determination by such government and agencies to
address the problem aggressively.
