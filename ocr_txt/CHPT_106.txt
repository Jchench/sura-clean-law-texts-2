any such notes is restrained by order of any court of competent jurisdic.
tion, such notary-public shall not protest the same ; and when the holder
of such notes shall cause more than one note or package to be protested
on the same day, he shall not receive pay for more than one protest.

So. 47. And be it further enacted, That on receiving notice that any
such asseciation has failed to redeem any of its circulating notes, as speci-
fied in thenext preceding section, the comptroller of the currency, with
the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury, may appoint a special
agent (of whose appointment immediate notice shall be given to such
association) who shall immediately proceed to ascertain whether such
association has refused to pay its circulating notes in the lawful money of
the United States, when demanded as aforesaid, and report to the comp-
troller the fact so ascertained ; and if, from such protest or the report so
made, the comptroller shall be satisfied that such association has refused
to pay its circulating notes as aforesaid and is in default, he shall, within
thirty days after he shall have received notice of such failure, declare the
United States bonds and securities pledged by such association forfeited
to the United States, and the same shall thereupon be forfeited accord-
ingly. And thereupon the comptroller shall immediately give notice in
such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall, by general rules or
otherwise, direct, to the holders of the circulating notes of such association
to present them for payment at the treasury of the United States, and
the same shall be paid as presented in lawful money of the United
States; whereupon said comptroller may, in his discretion, cancel an
amount of bonds pledged by such association equal at current market
rates, not exceeding par, to the notes paid. And it shall be lawful for the
Secretary of the Treasury, from time to time, to make such regulations
respecting the disposition to be made of such circulating notes after pre-
sentation thereof for payment as aforesaid, and respecting the perpetua-

disposed of as hereinafter specified, to reimburse to the United States the
amount so expended in paying the circulating notes of such association,

assets of such association; and such deficiency shall be made good out of
such assets in preference to any and all other claims whatsoever, except
the necessary costs and expenses of administering the same.

Sec. 48. And be it further enacted, That whenever the comptroller
shall become satisfied, as in the last preceding section specified, that any
association has refused to pay its circulating notes as therein mentioned,

association, as provided in the next preceding section, cause so much of
them as may be necessary to redeem the outstanding circulating notes of
such association to be sold at public auction in the city of New York,
after giving thirty days’ notice of such sale to such association.

rency may, if he shall"be of opinion that the interests of the United
States will be best promoted thereby, sell at private sale any of the bonds
pledged by such association, and receive therefor either money or the
circulating notes of such failing association: Provided, That no such
bonds shall be sold by private sale for less than par, nor less than the
market value thereof at the time of sale: And provided, further, That no
sales of any such bonds, either public or private, shall be complete until
