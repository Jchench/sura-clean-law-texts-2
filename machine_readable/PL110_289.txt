        limitations shall not exceed $417,000 for a mortgage secured by 
        a single-family residence, $533,850 for a mortgage secured by a

        adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning after the 
        effective date of the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform 
        Act of 2008, subject to the limitations in this paragraph. Each 
        adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it 
        may have been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to 
        the percentage increase, during the most recent 12-month or 4-

        last adjustment. Declines in the house price index shall be 
        accumulated and then reduce increases until subsequent increases 
        exceed prior declines.''.

        amended by adding after the period at the end the following:

        respect to properties of a particular size located in any area 
        for which 115 percent of the median house price for such size 
        residence exceeds the foregoing limitation for such size 
        residence, to

        110-185).

    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
securitization of mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association 
and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation plays an important role 
in providing liquidity to the United States housing markets. Therefore, 
the Congress encourages the Federal National Mortgage Association and 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to securitize mortgages 
acquired under the increased conforming loan limits established under 
this Act.

shall consider whether a transaction or activity of an enterprise is 
substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either (1) creates a 
new market, or (2) adds liquidity to an existing market. No credit 
toward the achievement of the housing goals and subgoals established 
under this section may be given to the purchase of mortgages, including 
any transaction or activity of an enterprise determined to be 
substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase, that is determined to 
be unacceptable or contrary to good lending practices, inconsistent with 
safety and soundness, or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises,

        housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-
        income families.

under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds 
issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in

            (4) Provides increased accountability and tracking of loan 
        originators.
            (5) Streamlines the licensing process and reduces the 
        regulatory burden.
            (6) Enhances consumer protections and supports anti-fraud 
        measures.

        Internet, regarding the employment history of, and publicly

[[Page 122 STAT. 2811]]

        adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against, loan 
        originators.

        originators would, to the greatest extent possible, be required 
        to act in the best interests of the consumer.
            (9) Facilitates responsible behavior in the subprime 
        mortgage market place and provides comprehensive training and 
        examination requirements related to subprime mortgage lending.
            (10) Facilitates the collection and disbursement of consumer 
        complaints on behalf of State and Federal mortgage regulators.

        Federal banking agencies, through the Financial Institutions 
        Examination Council, and the Farm Credit Administration shall 
        coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and

SEC. 1508. SECRETARY <<NOTE: States. Deadlines. 12 USC 5107.>> OF 
            HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT BACKUP AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH 
            A LOAN ORIGINATOR LICENSING SYSTEM.

    (a) Backup Licensing System.--If, by the end of the 1-year period, 
or the 2-year period in the case of a State whose legislature meets only 
biennially, beginning on the date of the enactment of this title or at 
any time thereafter, the Secretary determines that a State does not have 
in place by law or regulation a system for licensing and registering 
loan originators that meets the requirements of sections 1505 and 1506 
and subsection (d) of this section, or does not participate in the 
Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, the Secretary shall 
provide for the establishment and maintenance of a system for the 
licensing and registration by the Secretary of loan originators 
operating in such State as State-licensed loan originators.
    (b) Licensing and Registration Requirements.--The system established 
by the Secretary under subsection (a) for any State shall meet the 
requirements of sections 1505 and 1506 for State-licensed loan 
originators.
    (c)  <<NOTE: Public infomation.>> Unique Identifier.--The Secretary 
shall coordinate with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and 
Registry to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to 
each loan originator licensed by the Secretary as a State-licensed loan 
originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform 
identification of, and public access to, the employment history of and 
the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against 
loan originators.

    (d) State Licensing Law Requirements.--For purposes of this section, 
the law in effect in a State meets the requirements of this subsection 
if the Secretary determines the law satisfies the following minimum 
requirements:
            (1) A State loan originator supervisory authority is 
        maintained to provide effective supervision and enforcement of 
        such law, including the suspension, termination, or nonrenewal 
        of a license for a violation of State or Federal law.
            (2) The State loan originator supervisory authority ensures 
        that all State-licensed loan originators operating in the State 
        are registered with Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and 
        Registry.
            (3) <<NOTE: Reports.>> The State loan originator supervisory 
        authority is required to regularly report violations of such 
        law, as well

[[Page 122 STAT. 2819]]

        as enforcement actions and other relevant information, to the 
        Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
            (4) The State loan originator supervisory authority has a 
        process in place for challenging information contained in the 
        Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
            (5) The State loan originator supervisory authority has 
        established a mechanism to assess civil money penalties for 
        individuals acting as mortgage originators in their State 
        without a valid license or registration.
            (6) The State loan originator supervisory authority has 
        established minimum net worth or surety bonding requirements 
        that reflect the dollar amount of loans originated by a 
        residential mortgage loan originator, or has established a 
        recovery fund paid into by the loan originators.

    (e) Temporary Extension of Period.--The Secretary may extend, by not 
more than 24 months, the 1-year or 2-year period, as the case may be, 
referred to in subsection (a) for the licensing of loan originators in 
any State under a State licensing law that meets the requirements of 
sections 1505 and 1506 and subsection (d) if the Secretary determines 
that such State is making a good faith effort to establish a State 
licensing law that meets such requirements, license mortgage originators 
under such law, and register such originators with the Nationwide 
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.

SEC. 1509. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5108.>> BACKUP AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A 
            NATIONWIDE MORTGAGE LICENSING AND REGISTRY SYSTEM.

    If at any time the Secretary determines that the Nationwide Mortgage 
Licensing System and Registry is failing to meet the requirements and 
purposes of this title for a comprehensive licensing, supervisory, and

maintain such a system to carry out the purposes of this title and the 
effective registration and regulation of loan originators.

SEC. 1510. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5109.>> FEES.

    The Federal banking agencies, the Farm Credit Administration, the 
Secretary, and the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry may

access to such system and registry.

SEC. 1511. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5110.>> BACKGROUND CHECKS OF LOAN ORIGINATORS.

in providing identification and processing functions, the Attorney 
General shall provide access to all criminal history information to the 
appropriate State officials responsible for regulating State-licensed 
loan originators to the extent criminal history background checks are 
required under the laws of the State for the licensing of such loan 
originators.
    (b) Agent.--For the purposes of this section and in order to reduce 
the points of contact which the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have 
to maintain for purposes of subsection (a), the Conference of State Bank 
Supervisors or a wholly owned subsidiary may be used as a channeling 
agent of the States for requesting

[[Page 122 STAT. 2820]]

and distributing information between the Department of Justice and the 
appropriate State agencies.

rules of any Federal or State court) with respect to such information or 
material, shall continue to apply to such information or material after

provided by Federal and State laws.

material that is subject to a privilege or confidentiality under 
subsection (a) shall not be subject to--

        agency of the Federal Government or the respective State; or

        respect to any privilege held by the Nationwide Mortgage

        such information or material, the person to whom such 
        information or material pertains waives, in whole or in part, in 
        the discretion of such person, that privilege.

    (c) Coordination With Other Law.--Any State law, including any State 
open record law, relating to the disclosure of confidential supervisory 
information or any information or material described in subsection (a) 
that is inconsistent with subsection (a) shall be superseded by the 
requirements of such provision to the extent State law provides less 
confidentiality or a weaker privilege.

respect to the information or material relating to the employment 
history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement 
actions against, loan originators that is included in Nationwide

        regulations, the Secretary and examiners appointed by the 
        Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations and examine and 
        take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in 
        respect to the affairs of any such loan originator.
            (5) Assessments.--The cost of conducting any examination of 
        any loan originator operating in any State which is subject to a 
        licensing system established by the Secretary under section 1508 
        shall be assessed by the Secretary against the loan originator 
        to meet the Secretary's expenses in carrying out such 
        examination.

    (c) Cease and Desist Proceeding.--
            (1) Authority of secretary.--If the Secretary finds, after 
        notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is 
        violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of 
        this title, or any regulation thereunder, with respect to a 
        State which is subject to a licensing system established by the 
        Secretary under section 1508, the Secretary may publish such 
        findings and enter an order requiring such person, and any other 
        person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due 
        to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would 
        contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from 
        committing or causing such violation and any future violation

[[Page 122 STAT. 2822]]

        of the same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in 
        addition to requiring a person to cease and desist from 
        committing or causing a violation, require such person to 
        comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such 
        provision or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and 
        within such time as the Secretary may specify in such order. Any 
        such order may, as the Secretary deems appropriate, require 
        future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either 
        permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary may 
        specify, with such provision or regulation with respect to any 
        loan originator.
            (2)  <<NOTE: Notification. Deadline.>> Hearing.--The notice 
        instituting proceedings pursuant to paragraph (1) shall fix a 
        hearing date not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days 
        after service of the notice unless an earlier or a later date is 
        set by the Secretary with the consent of any respondent so 
        served.
            (3) Temporary order.--Whenever the Secretary determines that 
        the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in the 
        notice instituting proceedings pursuant to paragraph (1), or the 
        continuation thereof, is likely to result in significant 
        dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to 
        consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest prior to 
        the completion of the proceedings, the Secretary may enter a 
        temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and desist 
        from the violation or threatened violation and to take such 
        action to prevent the violation or threatened violation and to 
        prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to 
        consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest as the 
        Secretary deems appropriate pending completion of such 
        proceedings. Such an order shall be entered only after notice 
        and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Secretary determines 
        that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or 
        contrary to the public interest. <<NOTE: Effective date.>> A 
        temporary order shall become effective upon service upon the 
        respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the 
        Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain 
        effective and enforceable pending the completion of the 
        proceedings.
            (4) Review of temporary orders.--
                    (A) Review by secretary.--At any time after the 
                respondent has been served with a temporary cease and 
                desist order pursuant to paragraph (3), the respondent 
                may apply to the Secretary to have the order set aside, 
                limited, or suspended. If the respondent has been served 
                with a temporary cease and desist order entered without 
                a prior hearing before the Secretary, the respondent 
                may, within 10 days after the date on which the order 
                was served, request a hearing on such application and 
                the Secretary shall hold a hearing and render a decision 
                on such application at the earliest possible time.
                    (B) Judicial review.--Within--
                          (i) 10 days after the date the respondent was 
                      served with a temporary cease and desist order 
                      entered with a prior hearing before the Secretary; 
                      or
                          (ii) 10 days after the Secretary renders a 
                      decision on an application and hearing under 
                      paragraph (1), with respect to any temporary cease 
                      and desist order entered without a prior hearing 
                      before the Secretary,

[[Page 122 STAT. 2823]]

                the respondent may apply to the United States district 
                court for the district in which the respondent resides 
                or has its principal place of business, or for the 
                District of Columbia, for an order setting aside, 
                limiting, or suspending the effectiveness or enforcement 
                of the order, and the court shall have jurisdiction to 
                enter such an order. A respondent served with a 
                temporary cease and desist order entered without a prior 
                hearing before the Secretary may not apply to the court 
                except after hearing and decision by the Secretary on 
                the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).
                    (C) No automatic stay of temporary order.--The 
                commencement of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall 
                not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate 
                as a stay of the Secretary's order.
            (5) Authority of the secretary to prohibit persons from 
        serving as loan originators.--In any cease and desist proceeding 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue an order to 
        prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or 
        for such period of time as the Secretary shall determine, any 
        person who has violated this title or regulations thereunder, 
        from acting as a loan originator if the conduct of that person 
        demonstrates unfitness to serve as a loan originator.

    (d) Authority of the Secretary To Assess Money Penalties.--
            (1) In general.--
        The <<NOTE: Notification. Hearings.>> Secretary may impose a 
        civil penalty on a loan originator operating in any State which 
        is subject to a licensing system established by the Secretary 
        under section 1508, if the Secretary finds, on the record after 
        notice and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator 
        has violated or failed to comply with any requirement of this 
        title or any regulation prescribed by the Secretary under this 
        title or order issued under subsection (c).
            (2) Maximum amount of penalty.--The maximum amount of 
        penalty for each act or omission described in paragraph (1) 
        shall be $25,000.

    In addition to any authority allowed under State law a State 
licensing agency shall have the authority to conduct investigations and 
examinations as follows:
            (1) For the purposes of investigating violations or 
        complaints arising under this title, or for the purposes of 
        examination, the State licensing agency may review, investigate, 
        or examine any loan originator licensed or required to be 
        licensed under this title, as often as necessary in order to 
        carry out the purposes of this title.
            (2) <<NOTE: Records.>> Each such loan originator shall make 
        available upon request to the State licensing agency the books 
        and records relating to the operations of such originator. The 
        State licensing agency may have access to such books and records 
        and interview the officers, principals, loan originators, 
        employees, independent contractors, agents, and customers of the 
        licensee concerning their business.
            (3) The authority of this section shall remain in effect, 
        whether such a loan originator acts or claims to act under

        act without such authority.
            (4) No person subject to investigation or examination under 
        this section may knowingly withhold, abstract, remove, mutilate,

                payments are for a specific time period that will end on

                potentially to a higher amount, and that there is no 
                guarantee that the borrower will be able to refinance to 
                a lower amount.

        determined under section 107(c), the creditor shall furnish an 
        additional, corrected statement to the borrower, not later than

        consumer. If the disclosures are mailed to the consumer, the 
        consumer is considered to have received them 3 business days
