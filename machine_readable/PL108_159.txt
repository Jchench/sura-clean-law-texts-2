this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of

notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under 
subsection (a)--

        to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a 
        consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency 
        reasonably determines that--
                    ``(A) the information was blocked in error or a 
                block was requested by the consumer in error;

        is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected 
        consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as 
        consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under 
        section 611(a)(5)(B).
            ``(3) Significance of block.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the 
        presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the 
        blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the 
        consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained 
        possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the 
        block.

        consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any 
        request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the 
        consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from 
        any subsequent use, if--

        consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information 
        was obtained for resale.

section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which 
issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing 
negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of 
payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of 
information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a), a 
check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting 
agency described in section 603(p), any information identified in the 
subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.
    ``(f) Access to Blocked Information by Law Enforcement Agencies.--No 
provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer 
reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which 
the agency could otherwise obtain access under this title.''.

                information resulting

[[Page 117 STAT. 1967]]

                from identity theft, to prevent that person from 
                refurnishing such blocked information.
                    ``(B) Information alleged to result from identity 
                theft.--If a consumer submits an identity theft report

[[Page 117 STAT. 1972]]

    (d) Rulemaking <<NOTE: 15 USC 1681j note.>> Required.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall prescribe regulations 
        applicable to consumer reporting agencies described in section 
        603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to require the 
        establishment of--
                    (A) a centralized source through which consumers may 
                obtain a consumer report from each such consumer 
                reporting agency, using a single request, and without 
                charge to the consumer, as provided in section 612(a) of 
                the Fair Credit Reporting Act (as amended by this 
                section); and
                    (B) a standardized form for a consumer to make such 
                a request for a consumer report by mail or through an 
                Internet website.
            (2) Considerations.--In prescribing regulations under 
        paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider--
                    (A) the significant demands that may be placed on 
                consumer reporting agencies in providing such consumer 
                reports;
                    (B) appropriate means to ensure that consumer 
                reporting agencies can satisfactorily meet those 
                demands, including the efficacy of a system of 
                staggering the availability to consumers of such 
                consumer reports; and
                    (C) the ease by which consumers should be able to 
                contact consumer reporting agencies with respect to 
                access to such consumer reports.
            (3) Centralized source.--The centralized source for a 
        request for a consumer report from a consumer required by this 
        subsection shall provide for--
                    (A) a toll-free telephone number for such purpose;
                    (B) use of an Internet website for such purpose; and
                    (C) a process for requests by mail for such purpose.
            (4) Transition.--The regulations of the Commission under 
        paragraph (1) shall provide for an orderly transition by 
        consumer reporting agencies described in section 603(p) of the 
        Fair Credit Reporting Act to the centralized source for consumer 
        report distribution required by section 612(a)(1)(B), as amended 
        by this section, in a manner that--
                    (A) does not temporarily overwhelm such consumer 
                reporting agencies with requests for disclosures of 
                consumer reports beyond their capacity to deliver; and
                    (B) does not deny creditors, other users, and 
                consumers access to consumer reports on a time-sensitive 
                basis for specific purposes, such as home purchases or 
                suspicions of identity theft, during the transition 
                period.
            (5) Timing.--Regulations required by this subsection shall--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> be issued in final form not 
                later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this 
                Act; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Effective date.>> become effective not 
                later than 6 months after the date on which they are 
                issued in final form.
            (6) Scope of regulations.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commission shall, by rule, 
                determine whether to require a consumer reporting agency 
                that compiles and maintains files on consumers on 
                substantially a nationwide basis, other than one 
                described in section

[[Page 117 STAT. 1973]]

                603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to make free 
                consumer reports available upon consumer request, and if 
                so, whether such consumer reporting agencies should make 
                such free reports available through the centralized 
                source described in paragraph (1)(A).
                    (B) Considerations.--Before making any determination 
                under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall consider--
                          (i) the number of requests for consumer 
                      reports to, and the number of consumer reports 
                      generated by, the consumer reporting agency, in 
                      comparison with consumer reporting agencies 
                      described in subsections (p) and (w) of section 
                      603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act;
                          (ii) the overall scope of the operations of 
                      the consumer reporting agency;
                          (iii) the needs of consumers for access to 
                      consumer reports provided by consumer reporting 
                      agencies free of charge;
                          (iv) the costs of providing access to consumer 
                      reports by consumer reporting agencies free of 
                      charge; and
                          (v) the effects on the ongoing competitive 
                      viability of such consumer reporting agencies if 
                      such free access is required.

SEC. 212. DISCLOSURE OF CREDIT SCORES.

    (a) Statement on Availability of Credit Scores.--Section 609(a) of 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681g(a)) is amended by adding 
at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(6) If the consumer requests the credit file and not the

        obtain a credit score.''.

                   `notice to the home loan applicant

    `In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender 
must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency 
distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home 
loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.
    `The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the 
time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting 
agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your 
credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because 
they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will 
obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you 
may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, 
depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns 
change, and how credit scoring technologies change.
    `Because the score is based on information in your credit history, 
it is very important that you review the credit-related information that 
is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary 
from one company to another.
    `If you have questions about your credit score or the credit 
information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting 
agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or 
contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit 
score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to 
take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you 
with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.
    `If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the 
lender.'.

    (d) Inclusion of Key Factor in Credit Score Information in Consumer 
Report.--Section 605(d) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 
1681c(d)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``Disclosed.--Any consumer reporting 
        agency'' and inserting ``Disclosed.--
            ``(1) Title 11 information.--Any consumer reporting 
        agency''; and

        reporting agency that furnishes a consumer report that contains 
        any credit score or any other risk score or predictor on any 
        consumer shall include in the report a clear and conspicuous 
        statement that a key factor (as defined in section 609(f)(2)(B)) 
        that adversely affected such score or predictor was the number 
        of enquiries, if such a predictor was in fact a key factor that 
        adversely affected such score. This paragraph shall not apply to 
        a check services company, acting as such, which issues 
        authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing 
        negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar 
        methods of payments, but only to the extent that such company is 
        engaged in such activities.''.

    (e) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--Section 625(b) of the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681t(b)), as so designated by section 
214 of this Act, is amended--

                written offers of credit or insurance in connection with 
                transactions not initiated by the consumer; and
                    (B) the potential impact that any further 
                restrictions on providing consumers with such written 
                offers of credit or insurance would have on consumers.
            (2) Report.--The <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Board shall submit a 
        report summarizing the results of the study required under 
        paragraph (1) to the Congress not later than 12 months after the

                    (A) The current statutory or voluntary mechanisms

                insurance providers that the consumer does not wish to 
                receive written offers of credit or insurance.
                    (B) The extent to which consumers are currently 
                utilizing existing statutory and voluntary mechanisms to 
                avoid receiving offers of credit or insurance.
                    (C) The benefits provided to consumers as a result 
                of receiving written offers of credit or insurance.
                    (D) Whether consumers incur significant costs or are 
                otherwise adversely affected by the receipt of written 
                offers of credit or insurance.
                    (E) Whether further restricting the ability of 
                lenders and insurers to provide written offers of credit 
                or insurance to consumers would affect--
                          (i) the cost consumers pay to obtain credit or 
                      insurance;

                to the Congress that, together with any recommendations 
                for legislative or regulatory action--
                          (i) documents any changes in the areas of 
                      study referred to in paragraph (2)(A) occurring 
                      since the date of submission of the previous

                      of financial institutions and other creditors and 
                      users of consumer reports in sharing consumer

                      described in clause (ii) have had, if any, on the 
                      degree to which such affiliate sharing practices 
                      reduce the need for financial institutions, 
                      creditors, and other users of consumer reports to 
                      rely on consumer reports for such decisions.

SEC. 215. <<NOTE: 15 USC 1681 note.>> STUDY OF EFFECTS OF CREDIT SCORES 
            AND CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORES ON AVAILABILITY AND 
            AFFORDABILITY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS.

    (a) Study Required.--The Commission and the Board, in consultation 
with the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity of the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, shall conduct a study of--
            (1) the effects of the use of credit scores and credit-based 
        insurance scores on the availability and affordability of 
        financial products and services, including credit cards, 
        mortgages, auto loans, and property and casualty insurance;
            (2) the statistical relationship, utilizing a multivariate 
        analysis that controls for prohibited factors under the Equal 
        Credit Opportunity Act and other known risk factors, between 
        credit

[[Page 117 STAT. 1985]]

        scores and credit-based insurance scores and the quantifiable 
        risks and actual losses experienced by businesses;
            (3) the extent to which, if any, the use of credit scoring 
        models, credit scores, and credit-based insurance scores impact 
        on the availability and affordability of credit and insurance to 
        the extent information is currently available or is available 
        through proxies, by geography, income, ethnicity, race, color, 
        religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, and creed, 
        including the extent to which the consideration or lack of 
        consideration of certain factors by credit scoring systems could 
        result in negative or differential treatment of protected 
        classes under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the extent 
        to which, if any, the use of underwriting systems relying on 
        these models could achieve comparable results through the use of 
        factors with less negative impact; and
            (4) the extent to which credit scoring systems are used by 
        businesses, the factors considered by such systems, and the 
        effects of variables which are not considered by such systems.

    (b) Public Participation.--The Commission shall seek public input 
about the prescribed methodology and research design of the study 
described in subsection (a), including from relevant Federal regulators, 
State insurance regulators, community, civil rights, consumer, and 
housing groups.

            (1) In general.--Before <<NOTE: Deadline.>> the end of the 
        24-month period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act,

        Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.

            (1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct a study on 
        ways to improve the operation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
            (2) Areas for study.--In conducting the study under 
        paragraph (1), the Commission shall review--
                    (A) the efficacy of increasing the number of points 
                of identifying information that a credit reporting 
                agency is required to match to ensure that a consumer is 
                the correct individual to whom a consumer report relates 
                before releasing a consumer report to a user, 
                including--
                          (i) the extent to which requiring additional 
                      points of such identifying information to match 
                      would--
                                    (I) enhance the accuracy of credit 
                                reports; and
                                    (II) combat the provision of 
                                incorrect consumer reports to users;
                          (ii) the extent to which requiring an exact 
                      match of the first and last name, social security 
                      number, and address and ZIP Code of the consumer 
                      would enhance the likelihood of increasing credit 
                      report accuracy; and
                          (iii) the effects of allowing consumer 
                      reporting agencies to use partial matches of 
                      social security numbers and name recognition 
                      software on the accuracy of credit reports;

                negative information has been added to their credit 
                reports, including--
                          (i) the potential impact of such notification 
                      on the ability of consumers to identify errors on 
                      their credit reports; and

                      information from their credit reports;
                    (C) the effects of requiring that a consumer who has 
                experienced an adverse action based on a credit report 
                receives a copy of the same credit report that the 
                creditor relied on in taking the adverse action, 
                including--
                          (i) the extent to which providing such reports 
                      to consumers would increase the ability of 
                      consumers to identify errors in their credit 
                      reports; and
                          (ii) the extent to which providing such 
                      reports to consumers would increase the ability of 
                      consumers

                      to remove fraudulent information from their credit 
                      reports;
                    (D) any common financial transactions that are not 
                generally reported to the consumer reporting agencies, 
                but would provide useful information in determining the 
                credit worthiness of consumers; and
                    (E) any actions that might be taken within a 
                voluntary reporting system to encourage the reporting of 
                the types of transactions described in subparagraph (D).
            (3) Costs and benefits.--With respect to each area of study 
        described in paragraph (2), the Commission shall consider the 
        extent to which such requirements would benefit consumers, 
        balanced against the cost of implementing such provisions.

    (b) Report Required.--Not <<NOTE: Deadline.>> later than 1 year 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the chairman of the Commission 
shall submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
House of Representatives containing a detailed summary of the findings 
and conclusions of the study under this section, together with such 
recommendations for legislative or administrative actions as may be 
appropriate.

            (1) Interim reports.--The Commission shall submit an interim 
        report to the Congress on the study conducted under subsection 
        (a) at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of 
        enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter for 8 years.
            (2) Final report.--The Commission shall submit a final 
        report to the Congress on the study conducted under subsection 
        (a) at the end of the 2-year period beginning on the date on
