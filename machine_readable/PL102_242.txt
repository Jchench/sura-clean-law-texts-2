SEC. 143. E ARLY RESOLUTION.

(a) I n G e n e r a l . —It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal
banking agencies should facilitate early resolution of troubled in­
sured depository institutions whenever feasible if early resolution
would have the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance
fund, consistent with the least-cost and prompt corrective action
provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
(b) G e n e r a l P r i n c i p l e s . —In encouraging the Federal banking
agencies to pursue early resolution strategies, the Congress con­
templates that any resolution transaction under section 13(c) of that
Act would observe the following general principles:
(1) C o m p e t i t i v e n e g o t i a t i o n . —The transaction should be
negotiated competitively, taking into account the value of
expediting the process.
(2) R e s u l t i n g i n s t i t u t i o n a d e q u a t e l y c a p i t a l i z e d . —Any in­
sured depository institution created or assisted in the trans­

acquiring the troubled institution should meet all applicable
minimum capital standards.
(3) S u b s t a n t i a l p r i v a t e i n v e s t m e n t .—The transaction
should involve substantial private investment.
(4) C o n c e s s i o n s .—Preexisting owners and debtholders of any
troubled institution or its holding company should make
substantial concessions.
(5) Q u a l i f i e d m a n a g e m e n t . —Directors and senior manage­
ment of the resulting institution should be qualified to perform
their duties, and should not include individuals substantially
responsible for the troubled institution’s problems.
(6) FDIC’s p a r t i c i p a t i o n .—The transaction should give the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation an opportunity to
participate in the success of the resulting institution.
(7) S t r u c t u r e o f t r a n s a c t i o n .— The transaction should,
insofar as practical, be structured so that—
(A) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—
(i) does not acquire a significant proportion of the
troubled institution’s problem assets;
(ii) succeeds to the interests of the troubled institu­
tion’s preexisting owners and debtholders in proportion
to the assistance the Corporation provides; and
(iii) limits the Corporation’s assistance in term and
amount; and
(B) new investors share risk with the Corporation.
(c) R e p o r t . —Two years after the date of enactment of this Act, the

commercial lending company, without the prior approval of the
Board.
“ (2) R e q u i r e d s t a n d a r d s f o r a p p r o v a l — The Board may not
approve an application under paragraph (1) unless it determines
that—
“ (A) the foreign bank engages directly in the business of
banking outside of the United States and is subject to
comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated

“ (A) whether the appropriate authorities in the home
country of the foreign bank have consented to the proposed
establishment of a branch, agency or commercial lending
company in the United States by the foreign bank;
“ (B) the financial and managerial resources of the foreign
bank, including the bank’s experience and capacity to
engage in international banking;
“(C) whether the foreign bank has provided the Board
with adequate assurances that the bank will make avail­
able to the Board such information on the operations or
activities of the foreign bank and any affiliate of the bank
that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce
compliance with this Act, the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, and other applicable Federal law; and
“ (D) whether the foreign bank and the United States
affiliates of the bank are in compliance with applicable
United States law.
“ (4) F a c t o r .—In acting on an application under paragraph
(1), the Board shall not make the size of the foreign bank the
sole determinant factor, and may take into account the needs of
the community as well as the length of operation of the foreign
bank and its relative size in its home country. Nothing in this
paragraph shall affect the ability of the Board to order a State
branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary to
terminate its activities in the United States pursuant to any
standard set forth in this Act.
“ (5) E s t a b l i s h m e n t o f c o n d i t i o n s .—Consistent with the

agency, or subsidiary if the Board finds that—
“ (A) the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive
supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the
appropriate authorities in its home country; or
“(B)(i) there is reasonable cause to believe that such
foreign bank, or any affiliate of such foreign bank, has
committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or
unsound banking practice in the United States; and
“ (ii) as a result of such violation or practice, the contin­
ued operation of the foreign bank’s branch, agency or
commercial lending company subsidiary in the United
States would not be consistent with the public interest or
with the purposes of this Act, the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
However, in making findings under this paragraph, the Board
shall not make size the sole determinant factor, and may take
into account the needs of the community as well as the length of
operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home
country. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the ability of the
Board to order a State branch, agency, or commercial lending
company subsidiary to terminate its activities in the United
States pursuant to any standard set forth in this Act.
“ (2) D i s c r e t i o n t o d e n y h e a r i n g .—The Board may issue an

Subtitle F— Truth in Savings
SEC. 261. SHORT TITLE.

This subtitle may be cited as the “Truth in Savings Act” .
SEC. 262. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) F i n d i n g s .—The Congress hereby finds that economic stability
would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions
would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make
informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify ac­
counts, would be strengthened if there was uniformity in the disclo­
sure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are
assessed in connection with such accounts.
(b) P u r p o s e .—It is the purpose of this subtitle to require the clear
and uniform disclosure of—
(1) the rates of interest which are payable on deposit accounts
by depository institutions; and
(2) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts,
so that consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the
competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit
accounts.
SEC. 263. DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST RATES AND TERMS OF ACCOUNTS.

(a)
I n G e n e r a l . —Except as provided in subsection (b), each
advertisement, announcement, or solicitation initiated by any
depository institution or deposit broker relating to any demand or
interest-bearing account offered by an insured depository institution
which includes any reference to a specific rate of interest payable on
amounts deposited in such account, or to a specific yield or rate of

earnings on amounts so deposited, shall state the following informa­
tion, to the extent applicable, in a clear and conspicuous manner:
(1) The annual percentage yield.
(2) The period during which such annual percentage yield is
in effect.
(3) All minimum account balance and time requirements
which must be met in order to earn the advertised yield (and, in
the case of accounts for which more than 1 yield is stated, each
annual percentage yield and the account minimum balance
requirement associated with each such yield shall be in close
proximity and have equal prominence).
(4) The minimum amount of the initial deposit which is
required to open the account in order to obtain the yield adver­
tised, if such minimum amount is greater than the minimum
balance necessary to earn the advertised yield.
(5) A statement that regular fees or other conditions could
reduce the yield.
(6) A statement that an interest penalty is required for early
withdrawal.
(b) B r o a d c a s t a n d E l e c t r o n i c M e d i a a n d O u t d o o r A d v e r t i s i n g
E x c e p t i o n . —The Board may, by regulation, exempt advertisements,
announcements, or solicitations made by any broadcast or electronic
medium or outdoor advertising display not on the premises of the
depository institution from any disclosure requirements described in
paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (a) if the Board finds that any such
disclosure would be unnecessarily burdensome.
(c) M i s l e a d i n g D e s c r i p t i o n s o f F r e e o r N o - C o s t A c c o u n t s
P r o h i b i t e d . —No advertisement, announcement, or solicitation
made by any depository institution or deposit broker may refer to or
describe an account as a free or no-cost account (or words of similar
meaning) if—
(1) in order to avoid fees or service charges for any period—
(A) a minimum balance must be maintained in the ac­
count during such period; or
(B) the number of transactions during such period may
not exceed a maximum number; or
(2) any regular service or transaction fee is imposed.
(d) M i s l e a d i n g o r I n a c c u r a t e A d v e r t i s e m e n t s , E t c . , P r o h i b ­
i t e d . —No depository institution or deposit broker shall make any
advertisement, announcement, or solicitation relating to a deposit
account that is inaccurate or misleading or that misrepresents its
deposit contracts.

TITLE IV—MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
Subtitle A—Payment System Risk Reduction
SEC. 401. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

The Congress finds that—
(1) many financial institutions engage daily in thousands of
transactions with other financial institutions directly and
through clearing organizations;
(2) the efficient processing of such transactions is essential to
a smoothly functioning economy;
(3) such transactions can be processed most efficiently if,
consistent with applicable contractual terms, obligations among
financial institutions are netted;

12 USC 4401.

(4) such netting procedures would reduce the systemic risk
within the banking system and financial markets; and
(5) the effectiveness of such netting procedures can be assured
only if they are recognized as valid and legally binding in the
event of the closing of a financial institution participating in
the netting procedures.

Corporation—
(1) shall, in its capacity as a successor of a failed depository
institution (whether acting directly or through any bridge
bank), have the same obligation to provide a group health plan
meeting the requirements of section 602 of the Employee Retire­
ment Income Security Act of 1974 (relating to continuation
coverage requirements of group health plans) with respect to
former employees of such institution as such institution would
have had but for its failure, and
(2) shall require that any successor described in subsection
(b)(l)(B)(iii) provide a group health plan with respect to former
employees of such institution in the same manner as the failed
depository institution would have been required to provide but
for its failure.
(b) D e f i n i t i o n s .—For purposes of this section—

institution during any period if—
(A) such entity holds substantially all of the assets or

Subtitle J— Sense of the Congress Regarding
the Credit Crisis
SEC. 456. CREDIT CRUNCH.

(a) F i n d i n g s .—The Congress finds that—
(1) during the past year and a half a credit crunch of crisis
proportions has taken hold of the economy and grown increas­
ingly severe, particularly for real estate;
(2) to date the credit crisis has shown no sign of improvement
with its effects being felt broadly throughout the Nation as
business failures soar, financial institutions weaken, real estate
values decline, and State and local property tax bases further
erode;
(3)
approximately
$200,000,000,000
of
the
nearly
$400,000,000,000 in commercial real estate loans now held by
commercial banks are coming due within the next 2 years;
(4) banks for a variety of reasons, are reluctant to renew these
maturing real estate loans;
(5) both pension funds in the United States, with assets of
nearly $2,000,000,000,000, and a stronger and more active
secondary market for commercial real estate debt and equity
could play a more significant role in providing liquidity and
credit to the real estate and banking sectors of the economy;
(6) many regulatory practices encourage banks to reduce their
real estate lending without regard to long-term historical risk;
and
(7) the stability of real estate has suffered during the past
decade first from tax rules that in 1981 stimulated excessive
investment in real estate, and then in 1986 when rules were
adopted that discourage capital investment in real estate, artifi­
cially eroding real estate values.
(b) S e n s e o f t h e C o n g r e s s .—It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) immediate and carefully-coordinated action should be
taken by the Congress and the President to arrest the credit
crisis referred to in subsection (a) and provide a healthy and
efficient marketplace that works for owners, lenders, and inves­
tors; and
(2) that efforts should be undertaken to explore measures
that—

(A) modernize and simplify the rules that apply to pen­
sion investment in real estate to remove unnecessary bar­
riers to pension funds seeking to invest in real estate;
(B) strengthen the secondary market for commercial real
estate debt and equity by removing arbitrary obstacles to
private forms of credit enhancement;
(C) restore balance to the regulatory environment by
considering the impact of risk-based capital standards on
commercial, multifamily and single-family real estate;
ending mark-to-market, liquidation-based, appraisals;
encouraging loan renewals; and, fully communicating the
supervisory policy to bank examiners in the field; and
(D) rationalize the tax system for real estate owners and
operators by modifying the passive loss rules and encourag­
ing loan restructures.

purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘qualified savings

“(i) was chartered or organized as a savings associa­
tion before June 1,1991;
“(ii) had, immediately before the acquisition of such
