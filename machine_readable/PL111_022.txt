        TITLE II--FORECLOSURE MITIGATION AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY

SEC. 201. SERVICER SAFE HARBOR FOR MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATIONS.

    (a) <<NOTE: 15 USC 1639a note.>>  Congressional Findings.--Congress 
finds the following:
            (1) Increasing numbers of mortgage foreclosures are not only 
        depriving many Americans of their homes, but are also 
        destabilizing property values and negatively affecting State and 
        local economies as well as the national economy.
            (2) In order to reduce the number of foreclosures and to 
        stabilize property values, local economies, and the national 
        economy, servicers must be given--
                    (A) authorization to--
                          (i) modify mortgage loans and engage in other 
                      loss mitigation activities consistent with 
                      applicable guidelines issued by the Secretary of 
                      the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency 
                      Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; and
                          (ii) refinance mortgage loans under the Hope 
                      for Homeowners program; and
                    (B) a safe harbor to enable such servicers to 
                exercise these authorities.

    (b) Safe Harbor.--Section 129A of the Truth in Lending Act (15 
U.S.C. 1639a) is amended to read as follows:
``SEC. 129. DUTY OF SERVICERS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES.

    ``(a) In General.-- <<NOTE: Plan.>> Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, whenever a servicer of residential mortgages agrees to 
enter into a qualified loss mitigation plan with respect to 1 or more 
residential mortgages originated before the date of enactment of the 
Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, including mortgages held 
in a securitization or other investment vehicle--
            ``(1) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  to the extent that the 
        servicer owes a duty to investors or other parties to maximize 
        the net present value of such mortgages, the duty shall be 
        construed to apply to all such investors and parties, and not to 
        any individual party or group of parties; and

[[Page 123 STAT. 1639]]

            ``(2) <<NOTE: Deadline. Criteria.>>  the servicer shall be 
        deemed to have satisfied the duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, 
        before December 31, 2012, the servicer implements a qualified 
        loss mitigation plan that meets the following criteria:
                    ``(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has 
                occurred, is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as 
                such terms are defined by guidelines issued by the 
                Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the 
                Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
                    ``(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing 
                the mortgage as his or her principal residence.
                    ``(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent 
                with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the 
                Treasury or his designee, that the application of such 
                qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of 
                mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on 
                the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed 
                the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.

    ``(b) No Liability.--A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the 
best interests of all investors or other parties under this section 
shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection 
(a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other 
equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by 
the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.
    ``(c) Standard Industry Practice.--The qualified loss mitigation 
plan guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under the 
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 shall constitute standard 
industry practice for purposes of all Federal and State laws.
    ``(d) Scope of Safe Harbor.--Any person, including a trustee, 
issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or 
be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based 
solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such 
cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss 
mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).
    ``(e) Reporting.-- <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Each servicer that engages 
in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly 
report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results 
of the servicer's modification activities. The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall prescribe regulations or guidance specifying the form, content, 
and timing of such reports.

    ``(f) Definitions.--As used in this section--
            ``(1) the term `qualified loss mitigation plan' means--
                    ``(A) a residential loan modification, workout, or 
                other loss mitigation plan, including to the extent that 
                the Secretary of the Treasury determines appropriate, a 
                loan sale, real property disposition, trial 
                modification, pre-foreclosure sale, and deed in lieu of 
                foreclosure, that is described or authorized in 
                guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or 
                his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization 
                Act of 2008; and
                    ``(B) a refinancing of a mortgage under the Hope for 
                Homeowners program;
            ``(2) the term `servicer' means the person responsible for 
        the servicing for others of residential mortgage loans 
        (including of a pool of residential mortgage loans); and

            ``(3) the term `securitization vehicle' means a trust, 
        special purpose entity, or other legal structure that is used to

        pool of assets that includes residential mortgages (or 
        instruments that are related to residential mortgages such as 
        credit-linked notes).

    ``(g) Rule of Construction.--No provision of subsection (b) or (d) 
shall be construed as affecting the liability of any servicer or person 
as described in subsection (d) for actual fraud in the origination or 
servicing of a loan or in the implementation of a qualified loss 
mitigation plan, or for the violation of a State or Federal law, 
including laws regulating the origination of mortgage loans, commonly 
referred to as predatory lending laws.''.

            ``(1) In general.--The Stabilization Fund is authorized to 
        borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as 
        deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount of 
        all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund and 
        the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, is 
        limited to the amount provided for in section 203(d)(1),

                shall reset the rate again for all advances on each

                outstanding marketable obligations of the United States 
                with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.

        repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest 
        on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the Board 
        at its discretion. <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  All advances shall be 
        repaid not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the 
        first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board

90 days prior to each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the 
Board shall

Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If 
the Stabilization Fund might not have sufficient funds to make the 
repayment, the Board shall assess each federally insured credit union a 
special premium due and payable within 60 days in an aggregate amount 
calculated to ensure the Stabilization Fund is able to make the 
repayment. The premium charge for each credit union shall be stated as a 
percentage of its insured shares as represented on the credit union's 
previous call report. The percentage shall be identical for each credit 
union. Any credit union that fails to make timely payment of the special 
premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described under 
subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 202.

    ``(e) Distributions From Insurance Fund.--At the end of any calendar 
year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the 
Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution 
to insured credit unions described in section 202(c)(3). In lieu of the 
distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a 
distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible 
that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's equity ratio below the normal 
operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund's available 
assets ratio below 1.0 percent.
    ``(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund Assets.--The Board may 
request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the 
Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet 
the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be 
made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with 
maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as 
determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by 
the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market 
yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of 
comparable maturity.
    ``(g) Reports.--The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress 
on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the 
Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after 
each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). 
Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate 
stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the 
Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to 
the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial 
condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required 
future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to 
termination of the Fund.
    ``(h) Closing of Stabilization Fund.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Within 90 
days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund 
advance, or earlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall 
distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the 
Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the 
Stabilization Fund. <<NOTE: Extension.>>  If the Board extends the final 
repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date 
for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number 
of days.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 202(c)(3)(A) of the 
        Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(3)(A)) is amended by 
        inserting ``, subject to the requirements of section 217(e),''

SEC. 1002. <<NOTE: 42 USC 11301 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) a lack of affordable housing and limited scale of 
        housing assistance programs are the primary causes of 
        homelessness; and
            (2) homelessness affects all types of communities in the 
        United States, including rural, urban, and suburban areas.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--
            (1) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance programs 
        carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless 
        Assistance Act (consisting of the supportive housing program and 
        related innovative programs, the safe havens program, the 
        section 8 assistance program for single-room occupancy 
        dwellings, and the shelter plus care program) into a single 
        program with specific eligible activities;
            (2) to codify in Federal law the continuum of care planning 
        process as a required and integral local function necessary to 
        generate the local strategies for ending homelessness; and
            (3) to establish a Federal goal of ensuring that individuals 
        and families who become homeless return to permanent housing 
        within 30 days.
SEC. 1003. DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS.

    (a) In General.--Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless 
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections 
        (c) and (d); and
            (2) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of this Act, the terms `homeless', 
`homeless individual', and `homeless person' means--
            ``(1) an individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular,

                violence or childhood abuse, the presence of a child or

        other federal laws.--With respect to collaborative applicants 
        exercising the authority under section 422(j) to serve homeless 
        families with children and youth defined as homeless under other 
        Federal statutes, effectiveness in achieving the goals and

    (a) Study and Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 12-month 
period beginning on the date of the enactment of this division, the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study to 
examine homelessness and homeless assistance in rural areas and rural 
communities and submit a report to the Congress on the findings and 
conclusion of the study. The report shall contain the following matters:
            (1) A general description of homelessness, including the 
        range of living situations among homeless individuals and 
        homeless families, in rural areas and rural communities of the 
        United States, including tribal lands and colonias.
            (2) An estimate of the incidence and prevalence of 
        homelessness among individuals and families in rural areas and 
        rural communities of the United States.
            (3) An estimate of the number of individuals and families 
        from rural areas and rural communities who migrate annually to 
        non-rural areas and non-rural communities for homeless 
        assistance.
            (4) A description of barriers that individuals and families 
        in and from rural areas and rural communities encounter when 
        seeking to access homeless assistance programs, and 
        recommendations for removing such barriers.
            (5) A comparison of the rate of homelessness among 
        individuals and families in and from rural areas and rural 
        communities compared to the rate of homelessness among 
        individuals and families in and from non-rural areas and non-
        rural communities.

        individuals and families in rural areas and rural communities of 
        the United States.
            (7) A description of barriers that homeless assistance 
        providers serving rural areas and rural communities encounter 
        when seeking to access Federal homeless assistance programs, and 
        recommendations for removing such barriers.
            (8) An assessment of the type and amount of Federal homeless 
        assistance funds awarded to organizations serving rural areas 
        and rural communities and a determination as to whether such 
        amount is proportional to the distribution of homeless
