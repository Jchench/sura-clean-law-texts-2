SEC. 1001. STUDY AND REPORT BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL ON THE CURRENCY 
            TRANSACTION REPORT FILING SYSTEM.

    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study on the volume of currency transaction reports filed with 
the Secretary of the Treasury under section 5313(a) of title 31, United 
States Code.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the study required under subsection (a) 
shall be--
            (1) to evaluate, on the basis of actual filing data, 
        patterns of currency transaction reports filed by depository 
        institutions of all sizes and locations; and
            (2) to identify whether and the extent to which the filing 
        rules for currency transaction reports described in section 
        5313(a) of title 31, United States Code--
                    (A) are burdensome; and
                    (B) can or should be modified to reduce such burdens 
                without harming the usefulness of such filing rules to 
                Federal, State, and local anti-terrorism, law 
                enforcement, and regulatory operations.

    (c) Period Covered.--The study required under subsection (a) shall 
cover the period beginning at least 3 calendar years prior to the date 
of enactment of this section.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2008]]

    (d) Content.--The study required under subsection (a) shall include 
a detailed evaluation of--
            (1) the extent to which depository institutions are availing 
        themselves of the exemption system for the filing of currency 
        transaction reports set forth in section 103.22(d) of title 31, 
        Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect during the study 
        period (in this section referred to as the ``exemption 
        system''), including specifically, for the study period--
                    (A) the number of currency transaction reports filed 
                (out of the total annual numbers) involving companies 
                that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the 
                NASDAQ National Market;
                    (B) the number of currency transaction reports filed 
                by the 100 largest depository institutions in the United 
                States by asset size, and thereafter in tiers of 100, by 
                asset size;
                    (C) the number of currency transaction reports filed 
                by the 200 smallest depository institutions in the 
                United States, including the number of such currency 
                transaction reports involving companies listed on the 
                New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market; 
                and
                    (D) the number of currency transaction reports that 
                would have been filed during the filing period if the 
                exemption system had been used by all depository 
                institutions in the United States;
            (2) what types of depository institutions are using the 
        exemption system, and the extent to which such exemption system 
        is used;
            (3) difficulties that limit the willingness or ability of 
        depository institutions to reduce their currency transaction 
        reports reporting burden by making use of the exemption system, 
        including considerations of cost, especially in the case of 
        small depository institutions;
            (4) the extent to which bank examination difficulties have 
        limited the use of the exemption system, especially with respect 
        to--
                    (A) the exemption of privately-held companies 
                permitted under such exemption system; and
                    (B) whether, on a sample basis, the reaction of bank 
                examiners to implementation of such exemption system is 
                justified or inhibits use of such exemption system 
                without an offsetting compliance benefit;
            (5) ways to improve the use of the exemption system by 
        depository institutions, including making such exemption system 
        mandatory in order to reduce the volume of currency transaction 
        reports unnecessarily filed; and
            (6) the usefulness of currency transaction reports filed to 
        law enforcement agencies, taking into account--
                    (A) advances in information technology;
                    (B) the impact, including possible loss of 
                investigative data, that various changes in the 
                exemption system would have on the usefulness of such 
                currency transaction reports; and
                    (C) changes that could be made to the exemption 
                system without affecting the usefulness of currency 
                transaction reports.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2009]]

    (e) Assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall provide such 
information processing and other assistance, including from the 
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and the Director of the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, to the Comptroller General in 
analyzing currency transaction report filings for the study period 
described in subsection (c), as is necessary to provide the information 
required by subsection (a).
    (f) Views.--The study required under subsection (a) shall, if 
appropriate, include a discussion of the views of a representative 
sample of Federal, State, and local law enforcement and regulatory 
officials and officials of depository institutions of all sizes.
    (g) Recommendations.--The study required under subsection (a) shall, 
if appropriate, include recommendations for changes to the exemption 
system that would reflect a reduction in unnecessary cost to depository 
institutions, assuming reasonably full implementation of such exemption 
system, without reducing the usefulness of the currency transaction 
report filing system to anti-terrorism, law enforcement, and regulatory 
operations.
    (h) Report.--Not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of 
this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report on the study 
required under subsection (a) to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of 
the House of Representatives.

SEC. 1002. STUDY AND REPORT ON INSTITUTION DIVERSITY AND CONSOLIDATION.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study regarding--
            (1) the vast diversity in the size and complexity of 
        institutions in the banking and financial services sector, 
        including the differences in capital, market share, geographical 
        limitations, product offerings, and general activities;
            (2) the differences in powers among the depository 
        institution charters, including--
                    (A) identification of the historical trends in the 
                evolution of depository institution charters;
                    (B) an analysis of the impact of charter differences 
                to the overall safety and soundness of the banking 
                industry, and the effectiveness of the applicable 
                depository institution regulator; and
                    (C) an analysis of the impact that the availability 
                of options for depository institution charters on the 
                development of the banking industry;
            (3) the impact that differences of size and overall 
        complexity among financial institutions makes with respect to 
        regulatory oversight, efficiency, safety and soundness, and 
        charter options for financial institutions; and
            (4) the aggregate cost and breakdown associated with 
        regulatory compliance for banks, savings associations, credit 
        unions, or any other financial institution, including potential 
        disproportionate impact that the cost of compliance may pose on 
        smaller institutions, given the percentage of personnel that the 
        institution must dedicate solely to compliance.

    (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Comptroller General shall consider the efficacy and efficiency of 
the consolidation of financial regulators, as well as charter 
simplification and homogenization.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2010]]

    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a 
report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives on the results of the study required by this section.
