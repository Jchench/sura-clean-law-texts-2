                nonpublicly available data or information under this 
                subsection and subtitle B shall not constitute a waiver 
                of, or otherwise affect, any privilege arising under

                United States, including the degree of reliance on 
                short-term funding; and
                    (K) any other risk-related factors that the Council 
                deems appropriate.

    (c) Antievasion.--
            (1) Determinations.--In order to avoid evasion of this 
        title, the Council, on its own initiative or at the request of 
        the Board of Governors, may determine, on a nondelegable basis 
        and by a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then 
        serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, 
        that--
                    (A) material financial distress related to, or the

                States or any State or the financial activities in the 
                United States of a company incorporated or organized in 
                a country other than the United States would

[[Page 124 STAT. 1400]]

                pose a threat to the financial stability of the United 
                States, based on consideration of the factors in 
                subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable;
                    (B) the company is organized or operates in such a 
                manner as to evade the application of this title; and
                    (C) such financial activities of the company shall 
                be supervised by the Board of Governors and subject to 
                prudential standards in accordance with this title, 
                consistent with paragraph (3).
            (2) Report.--Upon making a determination under paragraph 
        (1), the Council shall submit a report to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress detailing the reasons for making such

            (3) Consolidated supervision of only financial activities; 
        establishment of an intermediate holding company.--
                    (A) Establishment of an intermediate holding 
                company.--Upon a determination under paragraph (1), the 
                company that is the subject of the determination may 
                establish an intermediate holding company in which the 
                financial activities of such company and its 
                subsidiaries shall be conducted (other than the 
                activities described in section 167(b)(2)) in compliance 
                with any regulations or guidance provided by the Board 
                of Governors. Such intermediate holding company shall be 
                subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and 
                to prudential standards under this title as if the 
                intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial 
                company supervised by the Board of Governors.
                    (B) Action of the board of governors.--To facilitate 
                the supervision of the financial activities subject to 
                the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of 
                Governors may require a company to establish an 
                intermediate holding company, as provided for in section 
                167, which would be subject to the supervision of the 
                Board of Governors and to prudential standards under 
                this title, as if the intermediate holding company were 
                a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors.
            (4) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final 
        determination; judicial review.-- 
        <<NOTE: Applicability.>> Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply 
        to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1) 
        in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank 
        financial companies.
            (5) Covered financial activities.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term ``financial activities''--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Definition.>> means activities that are 
                financial in nature (as defined in section 4(k) of the 
                Bank Holding Company Act of 1956);
                    (B) includes the ownership or control of one or more 
                insured depository institutions; and
                    (C) does not include internal financial activities 
                conducted for the company or any affiliate thereof, 
                including internal treasury, investment, and employee 
                benefit functions.
            (6) Only financial activities subject to prudential 
        supervision.--Nonfinancial activities of the company shall not

[[Page 124 STAT. 1401]]

        be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors and 
        prudential standards of the Board. For purposes of this Act, the 
        financial activities that are the subject of the determination 
        in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors. 
        Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority 
        of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under 
        this title to the financial activities that are subject to the 
        determination in paragraph (1).

    (d) Reevaluation and Rescission.--The Council shall--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> not less frequently than annually, 
        reevaluate each determination made under subsections (a) and (b) 
        with respect to such nonbank financial company supervised by the 
        Board of Governors; and
            (2) rescind any such determination, if the Council, by a 
        vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then serving, 
        including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, determines 
        that the nonbank financial company no longer meets the standards 
        under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable.

    (e) Notice <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> and Opportunity for Hearing and 
Final Determination.--
            (1) In general.--The Council shall provide to a nonbank

        company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors and shall 
        be subject to prudential standards in accordance with this 
        title.
            (2) Hearing.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        receipt of any notice of a proposed determination under

        writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the 
        Council to contest the proposed determination. Upon receipt of a 
        timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30 
        days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at 
        which such company may appear, personally or through counsel, to 
        submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the 
        Council, oral testimony and oral argument).
            (3) Final determination.--Not later than 60 days after the 
        date of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Council shall notify 
        the nonbank financial company of the final determination of the 
        Council, which shall contain a statement of the basis for the 
        decision of the Council.
            (4) No hearing requested.--If a nonbank financial company 
        does not make a timely request for a hearing, the Council shall 
        notify the nonbank financial company, in writing, of the final 
        determination of the Council under subsection (a) or (b), as 
        applicable, not later than 10 days after the date by which the 
        company may request a hearing under paragraph (2).

    (f) Emergency <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> Exception.--

        waive or modify the requirements of subsection (e) with respect 
        to a nonbank financial company, if the Council determines, by a 
        vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then serving, 
        including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that such 
        waiver or modification is necessary or appropriate to prevent or 
        mitigate

[[Page 124 STAT. 1402]]

        threats posed by the nonbank financial company to the financial 
        stability of the United States.
            (2) Notice.--The Council shall provide notice of a waiver or

        home country supervisor, if any, of the foreign nonbank 
        financial company that is being considered for such a 
        determination.
            (4) Opportunity for hearing.--The Council shall allow a 
        nonbank financial company to request, in writing, an opportunity 
        for a written or oral hearing before the Council to contest a 
        waiver or modification under this subsection, not later than 10 
        days after the date of receipt of notice of the waiver or 
        modification by the company. Upon receipt of a timely request, 
        the Council shall fix a time (not later than 15 days after the 
        date of receipt of the request) and place at which the nonbank 
        financial company may appear, personally or through counsel, to 
        submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the 
        Council, oral testimony and oral argument).
            (5) Notice of final determination.--Not later than 30 days 
        after the date of any hearing under paragraph (4), the Council

financial company under subsection (a), (b), or (c).
    (h) Judicial Review.--If <<NOTE: Deadline.>> the Council makes a

financial company, such nonbank financial company may, not later than 30 
days after the date of receipt of the notice of final determination 
under subsection (d)(2), (e)(3), or (f)(5), bring an action in the 
United States district court for the judicial district in which the home 
office of such nonbank financial company is located, or in the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order 
requiring that the final determination be rescinded, and the court 
shall, upon review, dismiss such action or direct the final 
determination to be rescinded. Review of such an action shall be limited 
to whether the final determination made under this section was arbitrary 
and capricious.

    (i) International Coordination.--
In <<NOTE: Consultation.>> exercising its duties under this title with 
respect to foreign nonbank financial companies, foreign-based bank 
holding companies, and cross-border activities and markets, the Council

                        GOVERNORS AND CERTAIN BANK HOLDING 
                        COMPANIES.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Purpose.--In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the 
        financial stability of the United States that could arise from 
        the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities 
        of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Council may 
        make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the 
        establishment and refinement of prudential standards and 
        reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to nonbank 
        financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and 
        large, interconnected bank holding companies, that--
                    (A) are more stringent than those applicable to 
                other nonbank financial companies and bank holding 
                companies that do not present similar risks to the 
                financial stability of the United States; and
                    (B) increase in stringency, based on the 
                considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).
            (2) Recommended application of required standards.--In 
        making recommendations under this section, the Council may--
                    (A) differentiate among companies that are subject 
                to heightened standards on an individual basis or by 
                category, taking into consideration their capital 
                structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities 
                (including the financial activities of their 
                subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors 
                that the Council deems appropriate; or
                    (B) recommend an asset threshold that is higher than 
                $50,000,000,000 for the application of any standard 
                described in subsections (c) through (g).

    (b) Development of Prudential Standards.--
            (1) In general.--The recommendations of the Council under 
        subsection (a) may include--
                    (A) risk-based capital requirements;
                    (B) leverage limits;
                    (C) liquidity requirements;
                    (D) resolution plan and credit exposure report 
                requirements;
                    (E) concentration limits;
                    (F) a contingent capital requirement;
                    (G) enhanced public disclosures;
                    (H) short-term debt limits; and
                    (I) overall risk management requirements.

[[Page 124 STAT. 1404]]

            (2) Prudential standards for foreign financial companies.--
        In making recommendations concerning the standards set forth in 
        paragraph (1) that would apply to foreign nonbank financial 
        companies supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based 
        bank holding companies, the Council shall--
                    (A) give due regard to the principle of national 
                treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and
                    (B) take into account the extent to which the 
                foreign nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank 
                holding company is subject on a consolidated basis to 
                home country standards that are comparable to those 
                applied to financial companies in the United States.
            (3) Considerations.--In making recommendations concerning 
        prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council shall--
                    (A) take into account differences among nonbank 
                financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors 
                and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), 
                based on--
                          (i) the factors described in subsections (a) 
                      and (b) of section 113;
                          (ii) whether the company owns an insured 
                      depository institution;
                          (iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations 
                      of the company; and
                          (iv) any other factors that the Council 
                      determines appropriate;
                    (B) to the extent possible, ensure that small 
                changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) 
                of section 113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous 
                changes in the prudential standards established under 
                section 165; and
                    (C) adapt its recommendations as appropriate in 
                light of any predominant line of business of such 
                company, including assets under management or other 
                activities for which particular standards may not be 
                appropriate.

    (c) Contingent Capital.--
            (1) Study required.--The Council shall conduct a study of 
        the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent 
        capital requirement for nonbank financial companies supervised 
        by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described 
        in subsection (a), which study shall include--
                    (A) an evaluation of the degree to which such 
                requirement would enhance the safety and soundness of 
                companies subject to the requirement, promote the 
                financial stability of the United States, and reduce 
                risks to United States taxpayers;
                    (B) an evaluation of the characteristics and amounts 
                of contingent capital that should be required;
                    (C) an analysis of potential prudential standards 
                that should be used to determine whether the contingent 
                capital of a company would be converted to equity in 
                times of financial stress;
                    (D) an evaluation of the costs to companies, the 
                effects on the structure and operation of credit and 
                other financial markets, and other economic effects of 
                requiring contingent capital;

[[Page 124 STAT. 1405]]

                    (E) an evaluation of the effects of such requirement 
                on the international competitiveness of companies 
                subject to the requirement and the prospects for 
                international coordination in establishing such 
                requirement; and
                    (F) recommendations for implementing regulations.
            (2) Report.--The Council shall submit a report to Congress 
        regarding the study required by paragraph (1) not later than 2 
        years after the date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Recommendations.--
                    (A) In general.--Subsequent to submitting a report 
                to Congress under paragraph (2), the Council may make 
                recommendations to the Board of Governors to require any 
                nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors and any bank holding company described in 
                subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of 
                contingent capital that is convertible to equity in 
                times of financial stress.
                    (B) Factors to consider.--In making recommendations 
                under this subsection, the Council shall consider--
                          (i) an appropriate transition period for 
                      implementation of a conversion under this 
                      subsection;
                          (ii) the factors described in subsection 
                      (b)(3);
                          (iii) capital requirements applicable to a 
                      nonbank financial company supervised by the Board

        resolution in the event of material financial distress or 
        failure.
            (2) Credit exposure report.--The Council may make 
        recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the 
        advisability of requiring each nonbank financial company

        described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the 
        Council, the Board of Governors, and the Corporation on--

                credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial 
                companies and significant bank holding companies; and

                bank holding companies have credit exposure to that 
                company.

    (e) Concentration Limits.--In order to limit the risks that the 
failure of any individual company could pose to nonbank financial

forth in section 165.

order to support market evaluation of the risk profile, capital 
adequacy, and risk management capabilities thereof.
    (g) Short-term Debt Limits.--The Council may make recommendations to 
the Board of Governors to require short-term debt limits to mitigate the 
risks that an over-accumulation of such debt could pose to bank holding 
companies described in subsection (a), nonbank financial companies 
supervised by the Board of Governors, or the financial system.

                    (A) <<NOTE: Notice.>> provides all other disputants 
                prior notice of the intent to request dispute resolution

                        TO ACTIVITIES OR PRACTICES FOR FINANCIAL 
                        STABILITY PURPOSES.

    (a) In General.--The Council may provide for more stringent 
regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to the 
primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or heightened 
standards and safeguards, including standards enumerated in section 115, 
for a financial activity or practice conducted by bank holding companies 
or nonbank financial companies under their respective jurisdictions, if 
the Council determines that the

[[Page 124 STAT. 1409]]

conduct, scope, nature, size, scale, concentration, or 
interconnectedness of such activity or practice could create or increase 
the risk of significant liquidity, credit, or other problems spreading 
among bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies, financial 
markets of the United States, or low-income, minority, or underserved 
communities.
    (b) Procedure for Recommendations to Regulators.--
            (1) Notice and opportunity for comment.--
        The <<NOTE: Consultation. Public comments.>> Council shall 
        consult with the primary financial regulatory agencies and 
        provide notice to the public and opportunity for comment for any 
        proposed recommendation that the primary financial regulatory 
        agencies apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for a 
        financial activity or practice.
            (2) Criteria.--The new or heightened standards and 
        safeguards for a financial activity or practice recommended 
        under paragraph (1)--
                    (A) shall take costs to long-term economic growth 
                into account; and
                    (B) may include prescribing the conduct of the 
                activity or practice in specific ways (such as by 
                limiting its scope, or applying particular capital or 
                risk management requirements to the conduct of the 
                activity) or prohibiting the activity or practice.

    (c) Implementation of Recommended Standards.--
            (1) Role of primary financial regulatory agency.--
                    (A) In general.--Each primary financial regulatory 
                agency may impose, require reports regarding, examine 
                for compliance with, and enforce standards in accordance 
                with this section with respect to those entities for 
                which it is the primary financial regulatory agency.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--The authority under this 
                paragraph is in addition to, and does not limit, any 
                other authority of a primary financial regulatory 
                agency. Compliance by an entity with actions taken by a 
                primary financial regulatory agency under this section 
                shall be enforceable in accordance with the statutes 
                governing the respective jurisdiction of the primary 
                financial regulatory agency over the entity, as if the 
                agency action were taken under those statutes.
            (2) Imposition of standards.--
        The <<NOTE: Deadline.>> primary financial regulatory agency 
        shall impose the standards recommended by the Council in 
        accordance with subsection (a), or similar standards that the 
        Council deems acceptable, or shall explain in writing to the 
        Council, not later than 90 days after the date on which the 
        Council issues the recommendation, why the agency has determined 
        not to follow the recommendation of the Council.

    (d) Report to Congress.--The Council shall report to Congress on--
            (1) any recommendations issued by the Council under this 
        section;
            (2) the implementation of, or failure to implement, such 
        recommendation on the part of a primary financial regulatory 
        agency; and
            (3) in any case in which no primary financial regulatory 
        agency exists for the nonbank financial company conducting 
        financial activities or practices referred to in subsection (a),

[[Page 124 STAT. 1410]]

        recommendations for legislation that would prevent such 
        activities or practices from threatening the stability of the 
        financial system of the United States.

    (e) Effect of Rescission of Identification.--
            (1) Notice.--The Council may recommend to the relevant 
        primary financial regulatory agency that a financial activity or 
        practice no longer requires any standards or safeguards 
        implemented under this section.
            (2) Determination of primary financial regulatory agency to 
        continue.--
                    (A) In general.--Upon receipt of a recommendation 
                under paragraph (1), a primary financial regulatory 
                agency that has imposed standards under this section 
                shall determine whether such standards should remain in 
                effect.
                    (B) Appeal process.--
                Each <<NOTE: Regulations.>> primary financial regulatory 
                agency that has imposed standards under this section 
                shall promulgate regulations to establish a procedure 
                under which entities under its jurisdiction may appeal a 
                determination by such agency under this paragraph that 
                standards imposed under this section should remain in 
                effect.

bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50,000,000,000 
or more, or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
Governors, poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United 
States, the Board of Governors, upon an affirmative vote of not fewer 
than \2/3\ of the voting members of the Council then serving, shall--
            (1) limit the ability of the company to merge with, acquire, 
        consolidate with, or otherwise become affiliated with another 
        company;

            (4) impose conditions on the manner in which the company 
        conducts 1 or more activities; or
            (5) if the Board of Governors determines that the actions 
        described in paragraphs (1) through (4) are inadequate to 
        mitigate a threat to the financial stability of the United 
        States in its recommendation, require the company to sell or 
        otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to

    (b) Notice <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> and Hearing.--
            (1) In general.--The Board of Governors, in consultation

        considered for mitigatory action pursuant to this section, 
        including an explanation of the basis for, and description of, 
        the proposed mitigatory action.
            (2) Hearing.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        receipt of notice under paragraph (1), the company may request, 
        in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before 
        the Board of Governors to contest the proposed mitigatory 
        action. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Board of Governors 
        shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of

[[Page 124 STAT. 1411]]

        receipt of the request) and place at which such company may

        consultation with the Council, oral testimony and oral 
        argument).
            (3) Decision.--Not later than 60 days after the date of a 
        hearing under paragraph (2), or not later than 60 days after the 
        provision of a notice under paragraph (1) if no hearing was 
        held, the Board of Governors shall notify the company of the 
        final decision of the Board of Governors, including the results 
        of the vote of the Council, as described in subsection (a).

    (c) Factors for Consideration.--The Board of Governors and the

Governors may prescribe regulations regarding the application of this 
section to foreign nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board 
of Governors and foreign-based bank holding companies--
            (1) giving due regard to the principle of national treatment 
        and equality of competitive opportunity; and
            (2) taking into account the extent to which the foreign 
        nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding company 
        is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards 
        that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in

a bank holding company, as provided

[[Page 124 STAT. 1422]]

in section 8(b)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1818(b)(3)).
    (b) Enforcement Authority for Functionally Regulated Subsidiaries.--

        paragraph (1), the primary financial regulatory agency does not 
        take supervisory or enforcement action against a subsidiary that 
        is acceptable to the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors

        supervisory or enforcement action, as if the subsidiary were a 
        bank holding company subject to supervision by the Board of 
        Governors.

                capital structure, riskiness,

[[Page 124 STAT. 1424]]

                complexity, financial activities (including the 
                financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and 
                any other risk-related factors that the Board of 
                Governors deems appropriate.
                    (B) Adjustment of threshold for application of 
                certain standards.--The Board of Governors may, pursuant 
                to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with 
                section 115, establish an asset threshold above 
                $50,000,000,000 for the application of any standard 
                established under subsections (c) through (g).

    (b) Development of Prudential Standards.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Required standards.--The Board of Governors 
                shall establish prudential standards for nonbank 
                financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors 
                and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), 
                that shall include--
                          (i) risk-based capital requirements and 
                      leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in 
                      consultation with the Council, determines that 
                      such requirements are not appropriate for a 
                      company subject to more stringent prudential 
                      standards because of the activities of such 
                      company (such as investment company activities or 
                      assets under management) or structure, in which 
                      case, the Board of Governors shall apply other 
                      standards that result in similarly stringent risk 
                      controls;
                          (ii) liquidity requirements;
                          (iii) overall risk management requirements;
                          (iv) resolution plan and credit exposure 
                      report requirements; and
                          (v) concentration limits.
                    (B) Additional standards authorized.--The Board of 
                Governors may establish additional prudential standards 
                for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board 
                of Governors and bank holding companies described in 
                subsection (a), that include--
                          (i) a contingent capital requirement;
                          (ii) enhanced public disclosures;
                          (iii) short-term debt limits; and
                          (iv) such other prudential standards as the 
                      Board or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a 
                      recommendation made by the Council in accordance 
                      with section 115, determines are appropriate.
            (2) Standards for foreign financial companies.--In applying 
        the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign nonbank 
        financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or 
        foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of Governors 
        shall--
                    (A) give due regard to the principle of national 
                treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and
                    (B) take into account the extent to which the 
                foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated 
                basis to home country standards that are comparable to 
                those applied to financial companies in the United 
                States.
            (3) Considerations.--In prescribing prudential standards 
        under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall--

[[Page 124 STAT. 1425]]

                    (A) take into account differences among nonbank 
                financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors 
                and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), 
                based on--
                          (i) the factors described in subsections (a) 
                      and (b) of section 113;
                          (ii) whether the company owns an insured 
                      depository institution;
                          (iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations 
                      of the company; and
                          (iv) any other risk-related factors that the 
                      Board of Governors determines appropriate;
                    (B) to the extent possible, ensure that small 
                changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) 
                of section 113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous 
                changes in the prudential standards established under 
                paragraph (1) of this subsection;
                    (C) take into account any recommendations of the 
                Council under section 115; and
                    (D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in 
                light of any predominant line of business of such 
                company, including assets under management or other 
                activities for which particular standards may not be 
                appropriate.
            (4) Consultation.--Before imposing prudential standards or 
        any other requirements pursuant to this section, including 
        notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent 
        requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices, 
        that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally 
        regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors 
        or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board 
        of Governors shall consult with each Council member that 
        primarily supervises any such subsidiary with respect to any 
        such standard or requirement.
            (5) Report.--The Board of Governors shall submit an annual 
        report to Congress regarding the implementation of the 
        prudential standards required pursuant to paragraph (1), 
        including the use of such standards to mitigate risks to the 
        financial stability of the United States.

    (c) Contingent Capital.--
            (1) In general.--Subsequent to submission by the Council of 
        a report to Congress under section 115(c), the Board of 
        Governors may issue regulations that require each nonbank 
        financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank 
        holding companies described in subsection (a) to maintain a 
        minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to 
        equity in times of financial stress.
            (2) Factors to consider.--In issuing regulations under this 
        subsection, the Board of Governors shall consider--
                    (A) the results of the study undertaken by the 
                Council, and any recommendations of the Council, under 
                section 115(c);
                    (B) an appropriate transition period for 
                implementation of contingent capital under this 
                subsection;
                    (C) the factors described in subsection (b)(3)(A);
                    (D) capital requirements applicable to the nonbank 
                financial company supervised by the Board of Governors

[[Page 124 STAT. 1426]]

                or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), 
                and subsidiaries thereof; and
                    (E) any other factor that the Board of Governors 
                deems appropriate.

    (d) Resolution Plan and Credit Exposure Reports.--
            (1) Resolution plan.--The Board of Governors shall require 
        each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
        Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) 
        to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, 
        and the Corporation the plan of such company for rapid and 
        orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress 
        or failure, which shall include--
                    (A) information regarding the manner and extent to 
                which any insured depository institution affiliated with 
                the company is adequately protected from risks arising 
                from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the 
                company;
                    (B) full descriptions of the ownership structure, 
                assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations of the 
                company;
                    (C) identification of the cross-guarantees tied to 
                different securities, identification of major 
                counterparties, and a process for determining to whom 
                the collateral of the company is pledged; and
                    (D) any other information that the Board of 
                Governors and the Corporation jointly require by rule or 
                order.
            (2) Credit exposure report.--The Board of Governors shall 
        require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board 
        of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection 
        (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the 
        Council, and the Corporation on--
                    (A) the nature and extent to which the company has 
                credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial 
                companies and significant bank holding companies; and
                    (B) the nature and extent to which other significant 
                nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding 
                companies have credit exposure to that company.
            (3) Review.--The Board of Governors and the Corporation 
        shall review the information provided in accordance with this 
        subsection by each nonbank financial company supervised by the 
        Board of Governors and bank holding company described in 
        subsection (a).
            (4) Notice of deficiencies.--If the Board of Governors and 
        the Corporation jointly determine, based on their review under 
        paragraph (3), that the resolution plan of a nonbank financial 
        company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding 
        company described in subsection (a) is not credible or would not 
        facilitate an orderly resolution of the company under title 11, 
        United States Code--
                    (A) the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall 
                notify the company of the deficiencies in the resolution 
                plan; and
                    (B) the company shall resubmit the resolution plan 
                within a timeframe determined by the Board of Governors 
                and the Corporation, with revisions demonstrating that 
                the plan is credible and would result in an orderly 
                resolution under title 11, United States Code, including 
                any

[[Page 124 STAT. 1427]]

                proposed changes in business operations and corporate 
                structure to facilitate implementation of the plan.
            (5) Failure to resubmit credible plan.--
                    (A) In general.--If a nonbank financial company 
                supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding 
                company described in subsection (a) fails to timely 
                resubmit the resolution plan as required under paragraph 
                (4), with such revisions as are required under 
                subparagraph (B), the Board of Governors and the 
                Corporation may jointly impose more stringent capital, 
                leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on 
                the growth, activities, or operations of the company, or 
                any subsidiary thereof, until such time as the company 
                resubmits a plan that remedies the deficiencies.
                    (B) Divestiture.--The Board of Governors and the 
                Corporation, in consultation with the Council, may 
                jointly direct a nonbank financial company supervised by 
                the Board of Governors or a bank holding company 
                described in subsection (a), by order, to divest certain 
                assets or operations identified by the Board of 
                Governors and the Corporation, to facilitate an orderly 
                resolution of such company under title 11, United States 
                Code, in the event of the failure of such company, in 
                any case in which--
                          (i) the Board of Governors and the Corporation 
                      have jointly imposed more stringent requirements 
                      on the company pursuant to subparagraph (A); and
                          (ii) the company has failed, within the 2-year 
                      period beginning on the date of the imposition of 
                      such requirements under subparagraph (A), to 
                      resubmit the resolution plan with such revisions 
                      as were required under paragraph (4)(B).
            (6) No limiting effect.--A resolution plan submitted in 
        accordance with this subsection shall not be binding on a 
        bankruptcy court, a receiver appointed under title II, or any 
        other authority that is authorized or required to resolve the 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board, any bank 
        holding company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the 
        foregoing.
            (7) No private right of action.--No private right of action 
        may be based on any resolution plan submitted in accordance with 
        this subsection.
            (8) Rules.--Not <<NOTE: Deadline.>> later than 18 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors 
        and the Corporation shall jointly issue final rules implementing 
        this subsection.

    (e) Concentration Limits.--
            (1) Standards.--In <<NOTE: Regulations.>> order to limit the 
        risks that the failure of any individual company could pose to a 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors 
        or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board 
        of Governors, by regulation, shall prescribe standards that 
        limit such risks.
            (2) Limitation on credit exposure.--The regulations 
        prescribed by the Board of Governors under paragraph (1) shall 
        prohibit each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board 
        of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection 
        (a) from having credit exposure to any unaffiliated company that 
        exceeds 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus (or such 
        lower amount as the Board of Governors may

[[Page 124 STAT. 1428]]

        determine by regulation to be necessary to mitigate risks to the 
        financial stability of the United States) of the company.
            (3) Credit exposure.--For <<NOTE: Definition.>> purposes of 
        paragraph (2), ``credit exposure'' to a company means--
                    (A) all extensions of credit to the company, 
                including loans, deposits, and lines of credit;
                    (B) all repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase 
                agreements with the company, and all securities 
                borrowing and lending transactions with the company, to 
                the extent that such transactions create credit exposure 
                for the nonbank financial company supervised by the 
                Board of Governors or a bank holding company described 
                in subsection (a);
                    (C) all guarantees, acceptances, or letters of 
                credit (including endorsement or standby letters of 
                credit) issued on behalf of the company;
                    (D) all purchases of or investment in securities 
                issued by the company;
                    (E) counterparty credit exposure to the company in 
                connection with a derivative transaction between the 
                nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors or a bank holding company described in 
                subsection (a) and the company; and
                    (F) any other similar transactions that the Board of 
                Governors, by regulation, determines to be a credit 
                exposure for purposes of this section.
            (4) Attribution rule.--For purposes of this subsection, any 
        transaction by a nonbank financial company supervised by the 
        Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in 
        subsection (a) with any person is a transaction with a company, 
        to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for 
        the benefit of, or transferred to, that company.
            (5) Rulemaking.--The Board of Governors may issue such 
        regulations and orders, including definitions consistent with 
        this section, as may be necessary to administer and carry out 
        this subsection.
            (6) Exemptions.--This subsection shall not apply to any 
        Federal home loan bank. The Board of Governors may, by 
        regulation or order, exempt transactions, in whole or in part, 
        from the definition of the term ``credit exposure'' for purposes 
        of this subsection, if the Board of Governors finds that the 
        exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with the 
        purpose of this subsection.
            (7) Transition period.--
                    (A) In general.--This <<NOTE: Effective 
                date.>> subsection and any regulations and orders of the 
                Board of Governors under this subsection shall not be 
                effective until 3 years after the date of enactment of 
                this Act.
                    (B) Extension authorized.--The Board of Governors

prescribe, by regulation, periodic public disclosures by nonbank 
financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank 
holding companies described in subsection (a) in order to support market

capabilities thereof.

[[Page 124 STAT. 1429]]

    (g) Short-term Debt Limits.--
            (1) In general.--In order to mitigate the risks that an 
        over-accumulation of short-term debt could pose to financial 
        companies and to the stability of the United States financial 
        system, the Board of Governors may, by regulation, prescribe a 
        limit on the amount of short-term debt, including off-balance 
        sheet exposures, that may be accumulated by any bank holding 
        company described in subsection (a) and any nonbank financial 
        company supervised by the Board of Governors.
            (2) Basis of limit.--Any limit prescribed under paragraph 
        (1) shall be based on the short-term debt of the company 
        described in paragraph (1) as a percentage of capital stock and 
        surplus of the company or on such other measure as the Board of 
        Governors considers appropriate.
            (3) Short-term debt defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term ``short-term debt'' means such liabilities 
        with short-dated maturity that the Board of Governors 
        identifies, by regulation, except that such term does not 
        include insured deposits.
            (4) Rulemaking authority.--In addition to prescribing 
        regulations under paragraphs (1) and (3), the Board of Governors 
        may prescribe such regulations, including definitions consistent 
        with this subsection, and issue such orders, as may be necessary

                subject to evaluation of whether such companies have the 
                capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to 
                absorb losses as a result of adverse economic 
                conditions.

                      the results of the required stress tests.

    (j) Leverage Limitation.--
            (1) Requirement.--The Board of Governors shall require a 
        bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or 
        greater than $50,000,000,000 or a nonbank financial company 
        supervised by the Board of Governors to maintain a debt to 
        equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1, upon a determination by 
        the Council that such company poses a grave threat to the 
        financial stability of the United States and that the imposition 
        of such requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that such 
        company poses to the financial stability of the United States. 
        Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to a Federal home loan 
        bank.
            (2) Considerations.--In making a determination under this 
        subsection, the Council shall consider the factors described in

        supervised by the Board of Governors, the computation of capital 
        for purposes of meeting capital requirements shall take into 
        account any off-balance-sheet activities of the company.
            (2) Exemptions.--If the Board of Governors determines that 
        an exemption from the requirement under paragraph (1) is 
        appropriate, the Board of Governors may exempt a company, or any 
        transaction or transactions engaged in by such company, from the 
        requirements of paragraph (1).

[[Page 124 STAT. 1432]]

            (3) Off-balance-sheet activities defined.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, the term ``off-balance-sheet activities'' means 
        an existing liability of a company that is not currently a 
        balance sheet liability, but may become one upon the happening 
        of some future event, including the following transactions, to 
        the extent that they may create a liability:

    (a) In General.--The <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Board of Governors, in 
consultation with the Council and the Corporation, shall prescribe 
regulations establishing requirements to provide for the early 
remediation of financial distress of a nonbank financial company 
supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described 
in section 165(a), except that nothing in this subsection authorizes the 
provision of financial assistance from the Federal Government.

    (b) Purpose of the Early Remediation Requirements.--The purpose of 
the early remediation requirements under subsection (a) shall be to 
establish a series of specific remedial actions to be taken by a nonbank 
financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding 
company described in section 165(a) that is experiencing increasing 
financial distress, in order to minimize the probability that the 
company will become insolvent and the potential harm of such insolvency 
to the financial stability of the United States.
    (c) Remediation Requirements.--The regulations prescribed by the 
Board of Governors under subsection (a) shall--
            (1) define measures of the financial condition of the 
        company, including regulatory capital, liquidity measures, and 
        other forward-looking indicators; and
            (2) establish requirements that increase in stringency as 
        the financial condition of the company declines, including--
                    (A) requirements in the initial stages of financial 
                decline, including limits on capital distributions, 
                acquisitions, and asset growth; and

of Governors, or a company that controls a nonbank financial company 
supervised by the Board of Governors, to conform the activities thereof 
to the requirements of section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1843).
    (b) Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) 
                Board <<NOTE: Deadline. Notification.>> authority.--If a 
                nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors conducts activities other than those that are 
                determined to be financial in nature or incidental 
                thereto under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company 
                Act of 1956, the Board of Governors may require such 
                company to establish and conduct all or a portion of 
                such activities that are determined to be financial in 
                nature or incidental thereto in or through an 
                intermediate holding company established pursuant to 
                regulation of the Board of Governors, not later than 90 
                days (or such longer period as the Board of Governors 
                may deem appropriate) after the date on which the 
                nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors is notified of the determination of the Board 
                of Governors under this section.
                    (B) Necessary actions.--Notwithstanding subparagraph 
                (A), the Board of Governors shall require a nonbank 
                financial company supervised by the Board of Governors 
                to establish an intermediate holding company if the 
                Board of Governors makes a determination that the 
                establishment of such intermediate holding company is 
                necessary to--
                          (i) appropriately supervise activities that 
                      are determined to be financial in nature or 
                      incidental thereto; or
                          (ii) to ensure that supervision by the Board 
                      of Governors does not extend to the commercial 
                      activities of such nonbank financial company.
            (2) Internal financial activities.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, activities that are determined to be financial in 
        nature or incidental thereto under section 4(k) of the Bank 
        Holding Company Act of 1956, as described in paragraph (1), 
        shall not include internal financial activities, including 
        internal treasury, investment, and employee benefit functions. 
        With respect to any internal financial activity engaged in for 
        the company or an affiliate and a non-affiliate of such company 
        during the year prior to the date of enactment of this Act, such 
        company (or an affiliate that is not an intermediate holding 
        company or subsidiary of an intermediate holding company) may 
        continue to engage in such activity, as long as not less than 2/
        3 of the assets or 2/3 of the revenues generated from the 
        activity are from or attributable to such company or an 
        affiliate, subject to review by the Board of Governors, to 
        determine whether engaging in such activity presents undue risk 
        to such company or to the financial stability of the United 
        States.
            (3) Source of strength.--A company that directly or 
        indirectly controls an intermediate holding company established 
        under this section shall serve as a source of strength to its 
        subsidiary intermediate holding company.
            (4) Parent company reports.--The Board of Governors may, 
        from time to time, require reports under oath from a

[[Page 124 STAT. 1434]]

        company that controls an intermediate holding company, and from 
        the appropriate officers or directors of such company, solely 
        for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this 
        section, including assessing the ability of the company to serve 
        as a source of strength to its subsidiary intermediate holding 
        company pursuant to paragraph (3) and enforcing such compliance.
            (5) Limited parent company enforcement.--
                    (A) In general.--In addition to any other authority 
                of the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors may 
                enforce compliance with the provisions of this 
                subsection that are applicable to any company described 
                in paragraph (1) that controls an intermediate holding 
                company under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act, and such company shall be subject to such section 
                (solely for such purposes) in the same manner and to the 
                same extent as if such company were a bank holding 
                company.
                    (B) Application of other act.--Any violation of this 
                subsection by any company that controls an intermediate 
                holding company may also be treated as a violation of 
                the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for purposes of 
                subparagraph (A).
                    (C) No effect on other authority.--No provision of 
                this paragraph shall be construed as limiting any 
                authority of the Board of Governors or any other Federal 
                agency under any other provision of law.

    (c) Regulations.--The Board of Governors--
            (1) shall <<NOTE: Criteria.>> promulgate regulations to 
        establish the criteria for determining whether to require a 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors 
        to establish an intermediate holding company under subsection 
        (b); and
            (2) may promulgate regulations to establish any restrictions 
        or limitations on transactions between an intermediate holding 
        company or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board 
        of Governors and its affiliates, as necessary to prevent unsafe 
        and unsound practices in connection with transactions between 
        such company, or any subsidiary thereof, and its parent company 
        or affiliates that are not subsidiaries of such company, except 
        that such regulations shall not restrict or limit any 
        transaction in connection with the bona fide acquisition or 
        lease by an unaffiliated person of assets, goods, or services.
SEC. 168. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5368.>> REGULATIONS.

determining whether a U.S. nonbank financial company or foreign nonbank 
financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require supervision by the Board of Governors of a U.S. 
nonbank financial company or foreign nonbank financial company, if such 
company does not meet the criteria for exemption established under 
subsection (a).
    (d) Revisions.--
            (1) In <<NOTE: Review.>> general.--The Board of Governors 
        shall, in consultation with the Council, review the regulations 
        promulgated under subsection (a), not less frequently than every 
        5 years, and based upon the review, the Board of Governors may 
        revise such regulations on behalf of, and in consultation with, 
        the Council to update as necessary the criteria set forth in 
        such regulations.
            (2) Transition period.--No revisions under paragraph (1) 
        shall take effect before the end of the 2-year period after the 
        date of publication of such revisions in final form.

Chairperson of the Council shall submit a joint report to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee 
on Financial Services of the House of Representatives not later than 30 
days after the date of the issuance in final form of regulations under 
subsection (a), or any subsequent revision to such regulations under 
subsection (d), as applicable. Such report shall include, at a minimum, 
the rationale for exemption and empirical evidence to support the 
criteria for exemption.

                banking agencies to apply to insured depository 
                institutions under the prompt corrective action 
                regulations implementing section 38 of the Federal

                section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,

                    (B) includes the regulatory capital components in 
                the numerator of those capital requirements, the risk-
                weighted assets in the denominator of those capital

                the denominator.
            (3) Definition of depository institution holding company.--
        The term ``depository institution holding company'' means a bank

        Board of Governors. The minimum risk-based capital requirements 
        established under this paragraph shall not be less than the

        agency may require, nor quantitatively lower than the generally 
        applicable risk-based capital requirements that were in effect 
        for insured depository institutions as of the date of enactment 
        of this Act.
            (3) Investments in financial subsidiaries.--For purposes of 
        this section, investments in financial subsidiaries that insured

        Insurance Act need not be deducted from regulatory capital by 
        depository institution holding companies or nonbank financial 
        companies supervised by the Board of Governors, unless such 
        capital deduction is required by the Board of Governors

                          (iii) concentrations in market share for any 
                      activity that would substantially disrupt

        be used to comply with Tier 1 capital requirements;

accordance with section 202(a)(1)(A), if, upon the written 
recommendation under subsection (a), the Secretary (in consultation with 
the President) determines that--
            (1) the financial company is in default or in danger of 
        default;
            (2) the failure of the financial company and its resolution 
        under otherwise applicable Federal or State law would have 
        serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United 
        States;
            (3) no viable private sector alternative is available to 
        prevent the default of the financial company;
            (4) any effect on the claims or interests of creditors, 
        counterparties, and shareholders of the financial company and 
        other market participants as a result of actions to be taken 
        under this title is appropriate, given the impact that any 
        action taken under this title would have on financial stability 
        in the United States;
            (5) any action under section 204 would avoid or mitigate 
        such adverse effects, taking into consideration the 
        effectiveness of the action in mitigating potential adverse 
        effects on the financial system, the cost to the general fund of 
        the Treasury, and the potential to increase excessive risk 
        taking on the part of creditors, counterparties, and 
        shareholders in the financial company;
            (6) a Federal regulatory agency has ordered the financial 
        company to convert all of its convertible debt instruments that 
        are subject to the regulatory order; and
            (7) the company satisfies the definition of a financial 
        company under section 201.

    (c) Documentation and Review.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall--
                    (A) document any determination under subsection (b);
                    (B) retain the documentation for review under 
                paragraph (2); and

[[Page 124 STAT. 1452]]

                    (C) <<NOTE: Notification.>> notify the covered

                determination.

                that could have had a significant impact on financial 
                stability, markets, or both;

                companies which may be able to provide the services 
                offered by the covered financial company;
                    (E) any potential international ramifications of 
                resolution of the covered financial company under other 
                applicable insolvency law;
                    (F) an estimate of the potential effect of the 
                resolution of the covered financial company under other 
                applicable insolvency law on the financial stability of 
                the United States;

                cause banks or other financial companies to experience 
                severe liquidity distress.

        subsidiaries and the separate resolution of any such insolvent 
        subsidiaries under other governmental authority, as appropriate; 
        and
            (4) shall consult with the Commission and the Securities 
        Investor Protection Corporation in the case of any covered 
        financial company for which the Corporation has been appointed

                                    (II) the period applicable under 
                                State law; and
                          (ii) in the case of any tort claim, the longer 
                      of--
                                    (I) the 3-year period beginning on 
                                the date on which the claim accrues; or
                                    (II) the period applicable under 
                                State law.
                    (B) Date on which a claim accrues.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), the date on which the statute of 
                limitations begins to run on any claim described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall be the later of--
                          (i) the date of the appointment of the 
                      Corporation as receiver under this title; or
                          (ii) the date on which the cause of action 
                      accrues.
                    (C) Revival of expired state causes of action.--
                          (i) In general.--In the case of any tort claim 
                      described in clause (ii) for which the applicable 
                      statute of limitations under State law has expired 
                      not more than 5 years before the date of 
                      appointment of the Corporation as receiver for a 
                      covered financial company, the Corporation may 
                      bring an action as receiver on such claim without 
                      regard to the expiration of the statute of 
                      limitations.
                          (ii) Claims described.--A tort claim referred 
                      to in clause (i) is a claim arising from fraud, 
                      intentional misconduct resulting in unjust 
                      enrichment, or intentional misconduct resulting in 
                      substantial loss to the covered financial company.
            (11) Avoidable transfers.--
                    (A) Fraudulent transfers.--The Corporation, as 
                receiver for any covered financial company, may avoid a 
                transfer of any interest of the covered financial 
                company in property, or any obligation incurred by the 
                covered financial company, that was made or incurred at 
                or within 2 years before the date on which the 
                Corporation was appointed receiver, if--
                          (i) the covered financial company voluntarily 
                      or involuntarily--
                                    (I) made such transfer or incurred 
                                such obligation with actual intent to 
                                hinder, delay, or defraud

[[Page 124 STAT. 1471]]

                                any entity to which the covered 
                                financial company was or became, on or 
                                after the date on which such transfer 
                                was made or such obligation was 
                                incurred, indebted; or
                                    (II) received less than a reasonably 
                                equivalent value in exchange for such 
                                transferor obligation; and
                          (ii) the covered financial company voluntarily 
                      or involuntarily--
                                    (I) was insolvent on the date that 
                                such transfer was made or such 
                                obligation was incurred, or became 
                                insolvent as a result of such transfer 
                                or obligation;
                                    (II) was engaged in business or a 
                                transaction, or was about to engage in 
                                business or a transaction, for which any 
                                property remaining with the covered 
                                financial company was an unreasonably 
                                small capital;
                                    (III) intended to incur, or believed 
                                that the covered financial company would 
                                incur, debts that would be beyond the 
                                ability of the covered financial company 
                                to pay as such debts matured; or
                                    (IV) made such transfer to or for 
                                the benefit of an insider, or incurred 
                                such obligation to or for the benefit of 
                                an insider, under an employment contract 
                                and not in the ordinary course of 
                                business.
                    (B) Preferential transfers.--The Corporation as 
                receiver for any covered financial company may avoid a 
                transfer of an interest of the covered financial company 
                in property--
                          (i) to or for the benefit of a creditor;
                          (ii) for or on account of an antecedent debt 
                      that was owed by the covered financial company 
                      before the transfer was made;
                          (iii) that was made while the covered 
                      financial company was insolvent;
                          (iv) that was made--
                                    (I) 90 days or less before the date 
                                on which the Corporation was appointed 
                                receiver; or
                                    (II) more than 90 days, but less 
                                than 1 year before the date on which the 
                                Corporation was appointed receiver, if 
                                such creditor at the time of the 
                                transfer was an insider; and
                          (v) that enables the creditor to receive more 
                      than the creditor would receive if--
                                    (I) the covered financial company 
                                had been liquidated under chapter 7 of 
                                the Bankruptcy Code;
                                    (II) the transfer had not been made; 
                                and
                                    (III) the creditor received payment 
                                of such debt to the extent provided by 
                                the provisions of chapter 7 of the 
                                Bankruptcy Code.
                    (C) Post-receivership transactions.--The Corporation 
                as receiver for any covered financial company may avoid 
                a transfer of property of the receivership that occurred 
                after the Corporation was appointed receiver that

[[Page 124 STAT. 1472]]

                was not authorized under this title by the Corporation 
                as receiver.
                    (D) Right of recovery.--To the extent that a 
                transfer is avoided under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), 
                the Corporation may recover, for the benefit of the 
                covered financial company, the property transferred or, 
                if a court so orders, the value of such property (at the 
                time of such transfer) from--
                          (i) the initial transferee of such transfer or 
                      the person for whose benefit such transfer was 
                      made; or
                          (ii) any immediate or mediate transferee of 
                      any such initial transferee.
                    (E) Rights of transferee or obligee.--The 
                Corporation may not recover under subparagraph (D)(ii) 
                from--
                          (i) any transferee that takes for value, 
                      including in satisfaction of or to secure a 
                      present or antecedent debt, in good faith, and 
                      without knowledge of the voidability of the 
                      transfer avoided; or
                          (ii) any immediate or mediate good faith 
                      transferee of such transferee.
                    (F) Defenses.--Subject to the other provisions of 
                this title--
                          (i) a transferee or obligee from which the 
                      Corporation seeks to recover a transfer or to 
                      avoid an obligation under subparagraph (A), (B), 
                      (C), or (D) shall have the same defenses available 
                      to a transferee or obligee from which a trustee 
                      seeks to recover a transfer or avoid an obligation 
                      under sections 547, 548, and 549 of the Bankruptcy 
                      Code; and
                          (ii) the authority of the Corporation to 
                      recover a transfer or avoid an obligation shall be 
                      subject to subsections (b) and (c) of section 546, 
                      section 547(c), and section 548(c) of the 
                      Bankruptcy Code.
                    (G) Rights under this section.--The rights of the 
                Corporation as receiver under this section shall be 
                superior to any rights of a trustee or any other party 
                (other than a Federal agency) under the Bankruptcy Code.
                    (H) Rules of construction; definitions.--For 
                purposes of--
                          (i) subparagraphs (A) and (B)--
                                    (I) the term ``insider'' has the 
                                same meaning as in section 101(31) of 
                                the Bankruptcy Code;
                                    (II) a transfer is made when such 
                                transfer is so perfected that a bona 
                                fide purchaser from the covered 
                                financial company against whom 
                                applicable law permits such transfer to 
                                be perfected cannot acquire an interest 
                                in the property transferred that is 
                                superior to the interest in such 
                                property of the transferee, but if such 
                                transfer is not so perfected before the 
                                date on which the Corporation is 
                                appointed as receiver for the covered 
                                financial company, such transfer is made 
                                immediately before the date of such 
                                appointment; and
                                    (III) the term ``value'' means 
                                property, or satisfaction or securing of 
                                a present or antecedent debt of the 
                                covered financial company, but does not

[[Page 124 STAT. 1473]]

                                include an unperformed promise to 
                                furnish support to the covered financial 
                                company; and
                          (ii) subparagraph (B)--
                                    (I) the covered financial company is 
                                presumed to have been insolvent on and 
                                during the 90-day period immediately 
                                preceding the date of appointment of the 
                                Corporation as receiver; and
                                    (II) the term ``insolvent'' has the 
                                same meaning as in section 101(32) of 
                                the Bankruptcy Code.
            (12) Setoff.--
                    (A) Generally.--Except as otherwise provided in this 
                title, any right of a creditor to offset a mutual debt 
                owed by the creditor to any covered financial company 
                that arose before the Corporation was appointed as 
                receiver for the covered financial company against a 
                claim of such creditor may be asserted if enforceable 
                under applicable noninsolvency law, except to the extent 
                that--
                          (i) the claim of the creditor against the 
                      covered financial company is disallowed;
                          (ii) the claim was transferred, by an entity 
                      other than the covered financial company, to the 
                      creditor--
                                    (I) after the Corporation was 
                                appointed as receiver of the covered 
                                financial company; or
                                    (II)(aa) after the 90-day period 
                                preceding the date on which the 
                                Corporation was appointed as receiver 
                                for the covered financial company; and
                                    (bb) while the covered financial 
                                company was insolvent (except for a 
                                setoff in connection with a qualified 
                                financial contract); or
                          (iii) the debt owed to the covered financial 
                      company was incurred by the covered financial 
                      company--
                                    (I) after the 90-day period 
                                preceding the date on which the 
                                Corporation was appointed as receiver 
                                for the covered financial company;
                                    (II) while the covered financial 
                                company was insolvent; and

                                financial company (except for a setoff 
                                in connection with a qualified financial

                      periods.>> with respect to a setoff in connection 
                      with a qualified financial contract, if a creditor 
                      offsets a mutual debt owed to the covered 
                      financial company against a claim of the covered 
                      financial company on or within the 90-day period 
                      preceding the date on which the Corporation is 
                      appointed as receiver for the covered financial 
                      company, the Corporation may recover from the 
                      creditor the amount so offset, to the extent that 
                      any insufficiency on the date of such setoff is 
                      less than the insufficiency on the later of--
                                    (I) the date that is 90 days before 
                                the date on which the Corporation is

                                period preceding the date

[[Page 124 STAT. 1474]]

                                on which the Corporation is appointed as 
                                receiver for the covered financial 
                                company.

                      subparagraph, the term ``insufficiency'' means the 
                      amount, if any, by which a claim against the 
                      covered financial company exceeds a mutual debt 
                      owed to the covered financial company by the 
                      holder of such claim.
                    (C) Insolvency.--The <<NOTE: Definition.>> term 
                ``insolvent'' has the same meaning as in section 101(32)

                    (D) Presumption <<NOTE: Time period.>> of 
                insolvency.--For purposes of this paragraph, the covered 
                financial company is presumed to have been insolvent on 
                and during the 90-day period preceding the date of 
                appointment of the Corporation as receiver.
                    (E) Limitation.--Nothing in this paragraph (12) 
                shall be the basis for any right of setoff where no such 
                right exists under applicable noninsolvency law.
                    (F) Priority claim.--Except as otherwise provided in 
                this title, the Corporation as receiver for the covered 
                financial company may sell or transfer any assets free 
                and clear of the setoff rights of any party, except that 
                such party shall be entitled to a claim, subordinate to 
                the claims payable under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), 
                and (D) of subsection (b)(1), but senior to all other 
                unsecured liabilities defined in subsection (b)(1)(E), 
                in an amount equal to the value of such setoff rights.
            (13) Attachment of assets and other injunctive relief.--
        Subject to paragraph (14), any court of competent jurisdiction 
        may, at the request of the Corporation as receiver for a covered 
        financial company, issue an order in accordance with Rule 65 of 
        the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including an order placing 
        the assets of any person designated by the Corporation under the 
        control of the court and appointing a trustee to hold such 
        assets.
            (14) Standards.--
                    (A) Showing.--Rule <<NOTE: Applicability.>> 65 of 
                the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply with 
                respect to any proceeding under paragraph (13), without 
                regard to the requirement that the applicant show that 
                the injury, loss, or damage is irreparable and 
                immediate.
                    (B) State proceeding.--If, in the case of any 
                proceeding in a State court, the court determines that 
                rules of civil procedure available under the laws of the 
                State provide substantially similar protections of the 
                right of the parties to due process as provided under 
                Rule 65 (as modified with respect to such proceeding by 
                subparagraph (A)), the relief sought by the Corporation 
                pursuant to paragraph (14) may be requested under the 
                laws of such State.
            (15) Treatment of claims arising from breach of contracts 
        executed by the corporation as receiver.--Notwithstanding any 
        other provision of this title, any final and non-appealable 
        judgment for monetary damages entered against the Corporation as 
        receiver for a covered financial company for the breach of an 
        agreement executed or approved by the Corporation after the date 
        of its appointment shall be paid as an administrative expense of 
        the receiver. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to 
        limit the power of a receiver

[[Page 124 STAT. 1475]]

        to exercise any rights under contract or law, including to 
        terminate, breach, cancel, or otherwise discontinue such

                Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.), which claim shall 
                be subordinate to the claims payable under subparagraphs 
                (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), but senior to all other 
                claims; and
                    (D) the Corporation may, after paying any proven 
                claims to customers under section 205 and the Securities

                    (C) Measure of damages for repudiation of qualified

                      costs of cover or other reasonable measures of 
                      damages utilized in the industries for such

                the amount lent plus accrued interest plus any accreted 
                original issue discount as of the date the Corporation 
                was appointed receiver of the covered financial company 
                and, to the extent that an allowed secured claim is 
                secured by property the value of which is greater than 
                the amount of such claim and any accrued interest 
                through the date of repudiation or disaffirmance, such 
                accrued interest pursuant to paragraph (1).
                    (E) Measure of damages for repudiation or 
                disaffirmance of contingent obligation.--In the case of

                of credit, loan commitment, or similar credit 
                obligation, the Corporation may, by rule or regulation, 
                prescribe that actual direct compensatory damages shall 
                be no less than the estimated value of the claim as of 
                the date the Corporation was appointed receiver of the 
                covered financial company, as such value is measured 
                based on the likelihood

[[Page 124 STAT. 1479]]

                that such contingent claim would become fixed and the 
                probable magnitude thereof.

        lessee.--
                    (A) In general.--If the Corporation as receiver 
                disaffirms or repudiates a lease under which the covered

                      accruing before the later of the date on which--

                                repudiation becomes effective, unless

                                the terms of the lease;

                      the lease; and
                          (iii) have a claim for any unpaid rent, 
                      subject to all appropriate offsets and defenses, 
                      due as of the date of the appointment which shall 
                      be paid in accordance with this paragraph and 
                      subsection (d).

                lessor and the lessee is not, as of the date of such 
                repudiation, in default, the lessee under such lease may 
                either--
                          (i) treat the lease as terminated by such 
                      repudiation; or

                      interest for the balance of the term of the lease, 
                      unless the lessee defaults under the terms of the 
                      lease after the date of such repudiation.
                    (B) Provisions applicable to lessee remaining in

                          (i) the lessee--
                                    (I) shall continue to pay the 
                                contractual rent pursuant to the terms

                                repudiation of such lease; and
                                    (II) may offset against any rent 
                                payment which accrues after the date of

                          (i) treat the contract as terminated by such 
                      repudiation; or
                          (ii) remain in possession of such real 
                      property.

                subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) the purchaser--
                                    (I) shall continue to make all 
                                payments due under the contract after 
                                the date of the repudiation of the 
                                contract; and
                                    (II) may offset against any such 
                                payments any damages which accrue after 
                                such date due to the nonperformance 
                                (after such date) of any obligation of 
                                the covered financial company under the 
                                contract; and

                    (C) Assignment and sale allowed.--
                          (i) In general.--No provision of this 
                      paragraph shall be construed as limiting the right 
                      of the Corporation as receiver to assign the 
                      contract described in subparagraph (A) and sell

                          (ii) No liability after assignment and sale.--
                      If an assignment and sale described in clause (i) 
                      is consummated, the Corporation as receiver shall 
                      have no further liability under the contract 
                      described in subparagraph (A) or with respect to 
                      the real property which was the subject of such 
                      contract.
            (7) Provisions applicable to service contracts.--
                    (A) Services performed before appointment.--In the 
                case of any contract for services between any person and 
                any covered financial company for which the Corporation 
                has been appointed receiver, any claim of such person 
                for services performed before the date of appointment 
                shall be--
                          (i) a claim to be paid in accordance with 
                      subsections (a), (b), and (d); and

                    (B) Services performed after appointment and prior 
                to repudiation.--If, in the case of any contract for 
                services described in subparagraph (A), the Corporation 
                as receiver accepts performance by the other person 
                before making any determination to exercise the right of 
                repudiation of such contract under this section--
                          (i) the other party shall be paid under the 
                      terms of the contract for the services performed; 
                      and
                          (ii) the amount of such payment shall be 
                      treated as an administrative expense of the 
                      receivership.
                    (C) Acceptance of performance no bar to subsequent 
                repudiation.--The acceptance by the Corporation as 
                receiver for services referred to in subparagraph (B) in 
                connection with a contract described in subparagraph (B) 
                shall not affect the right of the Corporation as 
                receiver to repudiate such contract under this section 
                at any time after such performance.
            (8) Certain qualified financial contracts.--

                this section, any other provision of Federal law, or the 
                law of any State, no person shall be stayed or 
                prohibited from exercising--

                      one or more qualified financial contracts 
                      described in clause (i); or
                          (iii) any right to offset or net out any 
                      termination value, payment amount, or other 
                      transfer obligation arising under or in connection 
                      with 1 or more contracts or agreements described 
                      in clause (i), including any master agreement for

                financial company, by any party to a contract or 
                agreement described in subparagraph (A)(i) with such 
                covered financial company.
                    (C) Certain transfers not avoidable.--

                      (a)(11), (a)(12), or (c)(12), section 5242 of the 
                      Revised Statutes of the United States, or any 
                      other provision of Federal or State law relating 
                      to the avoidance of preferential or fraudulent 
                      transfers, the Corporation, whether acting as the 
                      Corporation or as receiver for a covered financial 
                      company, may not avoid any transfer of money or 
                      other property in connection with

[[Page 124 STAT. 1482]]

                      any qualified financial contract with a covered 
                      financial company.
                          (ii) Exception for certain transfers.--Clause 
                      (i) shall not apply to any transfer of money or 
                      other property in connection with any qualified 
                      financial contract with a covered financial 
                      company if the transferee had actual intent to 
                      hinder, delay, or defraud such company, the 
                      creditors of such company, or the Corporation as

                                            obligations without Federal 
                                            assistance; or
                                            (bb) in the opinion of the 
                                        Corporation or such authority--
                                                (AA) the covered 
                                            financial company has 
                                            incurred or is likely to 
                                            incur losses that will 
                                            deplete all or substantially 
                                            all of its capital; and
                                                (BB) there is no 
                                            reasonable prospect that the 
                                            capital will be replenished 
                                            without Federal assistance.
                          (viii) Treatment of master agreement as one 
                      agreement.--Any master agreement for any contract 
                      or agreement described in any of clauses (i) 
                      through (vi) (or any master agreement for such 
                      master agreement or agreements), together with all 
                      supplements to such master agreement, shall be 
                      treated as a single agreement and a single 
                      qualified financial contact. If a master agreement 
                      contains provisions relating to agreements or 
                      transactions that are not themselves qualified 
                      financial contracts, the master agreement

[[Page 124 STAT. 1488]]

                      shall be deemed to be a qualified financial 
                      contract only with respect to those transactions 
                      that are themselves qualified financial contracts.
                          (ix) Transfer.--The term ``transfer'' means 
                      every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or 
                      conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of 
                      disposing of or parting with property or with an 
                      interest in property, including retention of title 
                      as a security interest and foreclosure of the 
                      equity of redemption of the covered financial 
                      company.
                          (x) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any 
                      governmental entity in addition to any entity 
                      included in the definition of such term in section 
                      1, title 1, United States Code.
                    (E) Clarification.--No provision of law shall be 
                construed as limiting the right or power of the 
                Corporation, or authorizing any court or agency to limit 
                or delay, in any manner, the right or power of the 
                Corporation to transfer any qualified financial contract 
                or to disaffirm or repudiate any such contract in 
                accordance with this subsection.
                    (F) Walkaway clauses not effective.--
                          (i) In general.--Notwithstanding the 
                      provisions of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph 
                      and sections 403 and 404 of the Federal Deposit 
                      Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, no 
                      walkaway clause shall be enforceable in a 
                      qualified financial contract of a covered 
                      financial company in default.
                          (ii) Limited suspension of certain 
                      obligations.--In <<NOTE: Time period.>> the case 
                      of a qualified financial contract referred to in 
                      clause (i), any payment or delivery obligations 
                      otherwise due from a party pursuant to the 
                      qualified financial contract shall be suspended 
                      from the time at which the Corporation is 
                      appointed as receiver until the earlier of--
                                    (I) the time at which such party 
                                receives notice that such contract has 
                                been transferred pursuant to paragraph 
                                (10)(A); or
                                    (II) 5:00 p.m. (eastern time) on the 
                                business day following the date of the 
                                appointment of the Corporation as 
                                receiver.
                          (iii) Walkaway clause defined.--For purposes 
                      of this subparagraph, the term ``walkaway clause'' 
                      means any provision in a qualified financial 
                      contract that suspends, conditions, or 
                      extinguishes a payment obligation of a party, in 
                      whole or in part, or does not create a payment 
                      obligation of a party that would otherwise exist, 
                      solely because of the status of such party as a 
                      nondefaulting party in connection with the 
                      insolvency of a covered financial company that is 
                      a party to the contract or the appointment of or 
                      the exercise of rights or powers by the 
                      Corporation as receiver for such covered financial 
                      company, and not as a result of the exercise by a 
                      party of any right to offset, setoff, or net 
                      obligations that exist under the contract, any 
                      other contract between those parties, or 
                      applicable law.

[[Page 124 STAT. 1489]]

                    (G) Certain obligations to clearing organizations.--
                In the event that the Corporation has been appointed as 
                receiver for a covered financial company which is a 
                party to any qualified financial contract cleared by or 
                subject to the rules of a clearing organization (as 
                defined in paragraph (9)(D)), the receiver shall use its 
                best efforts to meet all margin, collateral, and 
                settlement obligations of the covered financial company 
                that arise under qualified financial contracts (other 
                than any margin, collateral, or settlement obligation 
                that is not enforceable against the receiver under 
                paragraph (8)(F)(i) or paragraph (10)(B)), as required 
                by the rules of the clearing organization when due. 
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if 
                the receiver fails to satisfy any such margin, 
                collateral, or settlement obligations under the rules of 
                the clearing organization, the clearing organization 
                shall have the immediate right to exercise, and shall 
                not be stayed from exercising, all of its rights and 
                remedies under its rules and applicable law with respect 
                to any qualified financial contract of the covered 
                financial company, including, without limitation, the 
                right to liquidate all positions and collateral of such 
                covered financial company under the company's qualified 
                financial contracts, and suspend or cease to act for 
                such covered financial company, all in accordance with 
                the rules of the clearing organization.
                    (H) Recordkeeping.--
                          (i) Joint rulemaking.--The Federal primary 
                      financial regulatory agencies shall jointly 
                      prescribe regulations requiring that financial 
                      companies maintain such records with respect to 
                      qualified financial contracts (including market 
                      valuations) that the Federal primary financial 
                      regulatory agencies determine to be necessary or 
                      appropriate in order to assist the Corporation as 
                      receiver for a covered financial company in being 
                      able to exercise its rights and fulfill its 
                      obligations under this paragraph or paragraph (9) 
                      or (10).
                          (ii) Time frame.--The Federal primary 
                      financial regulatory agencies shall prescribe 
                      joint final or interim final regulations not later 
                      than 24 months after the date of enactment of this 
                      Act.
                          (iii) Back-up rulemaking authority.--If the 
                      Federal primary financial regulatory agencies do 
                      not prescribe joint final or interim final 
                      regulations within the time frame in clause (ii), 
                      the Chairperson of the Council shall prescribe, in 
                      consultation with the Corporation, the regulations 
                      required by clause (i).
                          (iv) Categorization and tiering.--The joint 
                      regulations prescribed under clause (i) shall, as 
                      appropriate, differentiate among financial 
                      companies by taking into consideration their size, 
                      risk, complexity, leverage, frequency and dollar 
                      amount of qualified financial contracts, 
                      interconnectedness to the financial system, and 
                      any other factors deemed appropriate.
            (9) Transfer of qualified financial contracts.--
                    (A) In general.--In making any transfer of assets or 
                liabilities of a covered financial company in default,

                Corporation as receiver for such covered financial 
                company shall either--
                          (i) transfer to one financial institution, 
                      other than a financial institution for which a 
                      conservator, receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or 
                      other legal custodian has been appointed or which 
                      is otherwise the subject of a bankruptcy or 
                      insolvency proceeding--
                                    (I) all qualified financial 
                                contracts between any person or any 
                                affiliate of such person and the covered 
                                financial company in default;
                                    (II) all claims of such person or 
                                any affiliate of such person against 
                                such covered financial company under any 
                                such contract (other than any claim 
                                which, under the terms of any such 
                                contract, is subordinated to the claims 
                                of general unsecured creditors of such 
                                company);
                                    (III) all claims of such covered 
                                financial company against such person or 
                                any affiliate of such person under any 
                                such contract; and
                                    (IV) all property securing or any 
                                other credit enhancement for any 
                                contract described in subclause (I) or 
                                any claim described in subclause (II) or 
                                (III) under any such contract; or

                      enhancement referred to in clause (i) (with

                or branch or agency thereof.--In transferring any 
                qualified financial contracts and related claims and 
                property under subparagraph (A)(i), the Corporation as

                make such transfer to a foreign bank, financial 
                institution organized under the laws of a foreign 
                country, or a branch or agency of a foreign bank or 
                financial institution unless, under the law applicable 
                to such bank, financial institution, branch or agency, 
                to the qualified financial contracts, and to any netting 
                contract, any security agreement or arrangement or other 
                credit enhancement related to one or more qualified 
                financial contracts, the contractual rights of the 
                parties to such qualified financial contracts, netting 
                contracts, security agreements or arrangements, or other 
                credit enhancements are enforceable substantially to the 
                same extent as permitted under this section.
                    (C) Transfer of contracts subject to the rules of a 
                clearing organization.--In the event that the 
                Corporation as receiver for a financial institution 
                transfers any qualified financial contract and related 
                claims, property, or credit enhancement pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A)(i) and such contract is cleared by or 
                subject to the rules of a clearing organization, the 
                clearing organization shall not be required to accept 
                the transferee as a member by virtue of the transfer.
                    (D) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph--

                category of claimants of the covered financial company, 
                if the Corporation determines that such payments or 
                credits are necessary or appropriate to minimize losses 
                to the Corporation as receiver from the orderly 
                liquidation of the covered financial company under this

                since the time of its execution, or with which, the 
                party claiming under the agreement provides 
                documentation of such agreement and its authorized 
                execution or confirmation by the covered financial 
                company that is acceptable to the receiver.

            (11) Federal agency approval; antitrust review.--If a 
        transaction involving the merger or sale of a bridge financial 
        company requires approval by a Federal agency, the transaction 
        may not be consummated before the 5th calendar day after the 
        date of approval by the Federal agency responsible for such 
        approval with respect thereto. 
        If, <<NOTE: Notification. Reports. Deadline.>> in connection 
        with any such approval a report on competitive factors from the

        the required waiting period shall end on the 15th day after the

        more than 3 additional 1-year periods.
            (13) Termination of bridge financial company status.--The 
        status of any bridge financial company as such shall terminate 
        upon the earliest of--
                    (A) the date of the merger or consolidation of the 
                bridge financial company with a company that is not a

[[Page 124 STAT. 1502]]

                substantially all of the assets of the bridge financial 
                company by a company that is not a bridge financial 
                company, or other entity as permitted under applicable 
                law; and
                    (E) the expiration of the period provided in 
                paragraph (12), or the earlier dissolution of the bridge 
                financial company, as provided in paragraph (15).
            (14) Effect of termination events.--
                    (A) Merger or consolidation.--A 
                merger <<NOTE: Delaware.>> or consolidation, described 
                in paragraph (13)(A) shall be conducted in accordance 
                with, and shall have the effect provided in, the 
                provisions of applicable law. For the purpose of 
                effecting such a merger or consolidation, the bridge 
                financial company shall be treated as a corporation 
                organized under the laws of the State of Delaware 
                (unless the law of another State has been selected by 
                the bridge financial company in accordance with 
                paragraph (2)(F)), and the Corporation shall be treated 
                as the sole shareholder thereof, notwithstanding any 
                other provision of State or Federal law.
                    (B) Charter conversion.--Following the sale of a 
                majority of the capital stock of the bridge financial 
                company, as provided in paragraph (13)(B), the 
                Corporation may amend the charter of the bridge 
                financial company to reflect the termination of the 
                status of the bridge financial company as such, 
                whereupon the company shall have all of the rights, 
                powers, and privileges under its constituent documents 
                and applicable Federal or State law. In connection 
                therewith, the Corporation may take such steps as may be 
                necessary or convenient to reincorporate the bridge 
                financial company under the laws of a State and, 
                notwithstanding any provisions of Federal or State law, 
                such State-chartered corporation shall be deemed to 
                succeed by operation of law to such rights, titles, 
                powers, and interests of the bridge financial company as 
                the Corporation may provide, with the same effect as if 
                the bridge financial company had merged with the State-
                chartered corporation under provisions of the corporate 
                laws of such State.
                    (C) Sale of stock.--Following the sale of 80 percent 
                or more of the capital stock of a bridge financial 
                company, as provided in paragraph (13)(C), the company 
                shall have all of the rights, powers, and privileges 
                under its constituent documents and applicable Federal 
                or State law. In connection therewith, the Corporation 
                may take such steps as may be necessary or convenient to 
                reincorporate the bridge financial company under the 
                laws of a State and, notwithstanding any provisions of 
                Federal or State law, the State-chartered corporation 
                shall be deemed to succeed by operation of law to such 
                rights, titles, powers and interests of the bridge 
                financial company as the Corporation may provide, with 
                the same effect as if the bridge financial company had 
                merged with the State-chartered corporation under 
                provisions of the corporate laws of such State.
                    (D) Assumption of liabilities and sale of assets.--
                Following the assumption of all or substantially all of 
                the liabilities of the bridge financial company, or the 
                sale of

[[Page 124 STAT. 1503]]

                all or substantially all of the assets of the bridge 
                financial company, as provided in paragraph (13)(D), at 
                the election of the Corporation, the bridge financial 
                company may retain its status as such for the period 
                provided in paragraph (12) or may be dissolved at the 
                election of the Corporation.
                    (E) Amendments to charter.--Following the 
                consummation of a transaction described in subparagraph 
                (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (13), the charter of 
                the resulting company shall be amended to reflect the 
                termination of bridge financial company status, if 
                appropriate.
            (15) Dissolution of bridge financial company.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
                of Federal or State law, if the status of a bridge 
                financial company as such has not previously been 
                terminated by the occurrence of an event specified in 
                subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (13)--
                          (i) the Corporation may, in its discretion, 
                      dissolve the bridge financial company in 
                      accordance with this paragraph at any time; and
                          (ii) the <<NOTE: Time period.>> Corporation 
                      shall promptly commence dissolution proceedings in 
                      accordance with this paragraph upon the expiration 
                      of the 2-year period following the date on which 
                      the bridge financial company was chartered, or any 
                      extension thereof, as provided in paragraph (12).
                    (B) Procedures.--The Corporation shall remain the 
                receiver for a bridge financial company for the purpose 
                of dissolving the bridge financial company. The

                shall wind up the affairs of the bridge financial 
                company in conformity with the provisions of law 
                relating to the liquidation of covered financial 
                companies under this title. With respect to any such 
                bridge financial company, the Corporation as receiver 
                shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges and 
                shall perform the duties related to the exercise of such 
                rights, powers, or privileges granted by law to the 
                Corporation as receiver for a covered financial company 
                under this title and, notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, in the exercise of such rights, 
                powers, and privileges, the Corporation shall not be 
                subject to the direction or supervision of any State 
                agency or other Federal agency.
            (16) Authority to obtain credit.--

                financial company is unable to obtain unsecured credit 
                or issue unsecured debt, the Corporation may authorize 
                the obtaining of credit or the issuance of debt by the 
                bridge financial company--
                          (i) with priority over any or all of the 
                      obligations of the bridge financial company;
                          (ii) secured by a lien on property of the 
                      bridge financial company that is not otherwise 
                      subject to a lien; or
                          (iii) secured by a junior lien on property of 
                      the bridge financial company that is subject to a 
                      lien.
                    (C) Limitations.--

[[Page 124 STAT. 1504]]

                          (i) In general.--The Corporation, after notice 
                      and a hearing, may authorize the obtaining of 
                      credit or the issuance of debt by a bridge 
                      financial company that is secured by a senior or 
                      equal lien on property of the bridge financial 
                      company that is subject to a lien, only if--
                                    (I) the bridge financial company is 
                                unable to otherwise obtain such credit 
                                or issue such debt; and
                                    (II) there is adequate protection of 
                                the interest of the holder of the lien 
                                on the property with respect to which 
                                such senior or equal lien is proposed to 
                                be granted.
                          (ii) Hearing.--The hearing required pursuant 
                      to this subparagraph shall be before a court of 
                      the United States, which shall have jurisdiction 
                      to conduct such hearing and to authorize a bridge 
                      financial company to obtain secured credit under 
                      clause (i).
                    (D) Burden of proof.--In any hearing under this 
                paragraph, the Corporation has the burden of proof on 
                the issue of adequate protection.
                    (E) Qualified financial contracts.--No credit or 
                debt obtained or issued by a bridge financial company 
                may contain terms that impair the rights of a 
                counterparty to a qualified financial contract upon a 
                default by the bridge financial company, other than the 
                priority of such counterparty's unsecured claim (after 
                the exercise of rights) relative to the priority of the 
                bridge financial company's obligations in respect of 
                such credit or debt, unless such counterparty consents 
                in writing to any such impairment.
            (17) Effect on debts and liens.--The reversal or 
        modification on appeal of an authorization under this subsection 
        to obtain credit or issue debt, or of a grant under this section 
        of a priority or a lien, does not affect the validity of any 
        debt so issued, or any priority or lien so granted, to an entity 
        that extended such credit in good faith, whether or not such 
        entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless such 
        authorization and the issuance of such debt, or the granting of 
        such priority or lien, were stayed pending appeal.

    (i) Sharing Records.--If the Corporation has been appointed as 
receiver for a covered financial company, other Federal regulators shall 
make all records relating to the covered financial company available to 
the Corporation, which may be used by the Corporation in any manner that 
the Corporation determines to be appropriate.
    (j) Expedited Procedures for Certain Claims.--
            (1) Time for filing notice of appeal.--
        The <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> notice of appeal of any order, whether 
        interlocutory or final, entered in any case brought by the 
        Corporation against a director, officer, employee, agent, 
        attorney, accountant, or appraiser of the covered financial 
        company, or any other person employed by or providing services 
        to a covered financial company, shall be filed not later than 30 
        days after the date of entry of the order. The hearing of the 
        appeal shall be held not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the notice of appeal. The appeal shall be decided not later than 
        180 days after the date of the notice of appeal.

[[Page 124 STAT. 1505]]

            (2) Scheduling.--The <<NOTE: Courts.>> court shall expedite 
        the consideration of any case brought by the Corporation against 
        a director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, accountant, or 
        appraiser of a covered financial company or any other person 
        employed by or providing services to a covered financial 
        company. As far as practicable, the court shall give such case 
        priority on its docket.
            (3) Judicial discretion.--The court may modify the schedule 
        and limitations stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a particular 
        case, based on a specific finding that the ends of justice that 
        would be served by making such a modification would outweigh the 
        best interest of the public in having the case resolved 
        expeditiously.

    (k) Foreign Investigations.--The Corporation, as receiver for any 
covered financial company, and for purposes of carrying out any power, 
authority, or duty with respect to a covered financial company--
            (1) may request the assistance of any foreign financial 
        authority and provide assistance to any foreign financial 
        authority in accordance with section 8(v) of the Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Act, as if the covered financial company were an 
        insured depository institution, the Corporation were the 
        appropriate Federal banking agency for the company, and any 
        foreign financial authority were the foreign banking authority; 
        and
            (2) may maintain an office to coordinate foreign 
        investigations or investigations on behalf of foreign financial 
        authorities.

    (l) Prohibition on Entering Secrecy Agreements and Protective 
Orders.--The Corporation may not enter into any agreement or approve any 
protective order which prohibits the Corporation from disclosing the 
terms of any settlement of an administrative or other action for damages

        (relating to Federal information policy; commonly known as the 
        Paperwork Reduction Act), in collecting such data or

        insurance have experienced shifts in the volume of business 
        between admitted and nonadmitted insurance; and
            (5) the extent to which there has been a change in the 
        number of individuals who have nonadmitted insurance policies,

            (3) Examination authority.--
                    (A) Focus of examination authority.--The Board of 
                Governors may make examinations of any supervised 
                securities holding company and any affiliate of a 
                supervised securities holding company to carry out this 
                subsection, to prevent evasions thereof, and to monitor 
                compliance by the supervised securities holding company

        companies and address the risks posed to financial stability by 
        supervised securities holding companies.
            (2) Differentiation.--In imposing standards under this

                holding company as a source of credit for households, 
                businesses,

[[Page 124 STAT. 1620]]

                and State and local governments, and as a source of

        company, in the same manner as such subsections apply to a bank 
        holding company for which the Board of Governors is the 
        appropriate Federal banking agency. For purposes of applying 
        such subsections to a supervised securities holding company or a 
        subsidiary (other than a bank or an institution described in 
        subparagraph (D), (F), or (H) of section 2(c)(2) of the Bank

        supervised securities holding company, the Board of Governors 
        shall be deemed the appropriate Federal banking agency for the 
        supervised securities holding company or subsidiary.
            (2) Bank holding company act of 1956.--Except as the Board 
        of Governors may otherwise provide by regulation or order, a

        provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
        1841 et seq.) in the same manner and to the same extent a bank 
        holding company is subject to such provisions, except that a 
        supervised securities holding company may not, by reason of this 
        paragraph, be deemed to be a bank holding company for purposes 
        of section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
        1843).

                include any major swap participant or major security-
                based swap participant that is an insured depository 
                institution.

    (c) Affiliates of Insured Depository Institutions.--The prohibition 
on Federal assistance contained in subsection (a) does not apply to and 
shall not prevent an insured depository institution from having or 
establishing an affiliate which is a swaps entity, as long as such 
insured depository institution is part of a bank holding company, or 
savings and loan holding company, that is supervised by the Federal 
Reserve and such swaps entity affiliate complies with sections 23A and 
23B of the Federal Reserve Act and such other requirements as the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities Exchange 
Commission, as appropriate, and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, may determine to be necessary and appropriate.
    (d) Only Bona Fide Hedging and Traditional Bank Activities 
Permitted.--The prohibition <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  in subsection (a) 
shall apply to any insured depository institution unless the insured 
depository institution limits its swap or security-based swap activities

            (1) Hedging and other similar risk mitigating activities 
        directly related to the insured depository institution's 
        activities.
            (2) Acting as a swaps entity for swaps or security-based 
        swaps involving rates or reference assets that are permissible

        entity for credit default swaps, including swaps or security-
        based swaps referencing the credit risk of asset-backed 
        securities as defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities 
        Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77)) (as amended by this 
        Act) shall not be considered a bank permissible activity for 
        purposes of subsection (d)(2) unless such swaps or security-
        based swaps are cleared by a derivatives clearing organization 
        (as such term is defined in section la of the Commodity Exchange 
        Act (7 U.S.C. la)) or a clearing agency (as such term is defined 
        in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c)) 
        that is registered, or exempt from registration, as a 
        derivatives clearing organization under the Commodity Exchange 
        Act or as a clearing agency under the Securities Exchange Act, 
        respectively.

    (e) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  Existing Swaps and Security-based 
Swaps.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall only apply to swaps or 
security-based swaps entered into by an insured depository institution 
after the end of the transition period described in subsection (f).

    (f) Transition Period.--To the extent an insured depository 
institution qualifies as a ``swaps entity'' and would be subject to the 
Federal assistance prohibition in subsection (a), the appropriate 
Federal banking agency, after consulting with and considering the views 
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities Exchange 
Commission, as appropriate, shall permit the insured depository 
institution up to 24 months to divest the swaps entity or cease the 
activities that require registration as a swaps entity. In establishing 
the appropriate transition period to effect such divestiture or 
cessation of activities, which may include making the swaps entity an 
affiliate of the insured depository institution, the appropriate Federal 
banking agency shall take into account and make written findings 
regarding the potential impact of such divestiture or cessation of 
activities on the insured depository institution's (1) mortgage lending, 
(2) small business lending, (3) job creation, and (4) capital formation 
versus the potential negative impact on insured depositors and the 
Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The 
appropriate Federal banking agency may consider such other factors as 
may be appropriate. The appropriate Federal banking agency may place 
such conditions on the insured depository institution's divestiture or 
ceasing of activities of the swaps entity as it deems necessary and 
appropriate. The transition period under this subsection may be extended 
by the appropriate Federal banking agency, after consultation with the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, for a period of up to 1 additional year.
    (g) Excluded Entities.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``swaps entity'' shall not include any insured depository institution

as are reasonably calculated to permit the swaps entity to conduct its 
swap or security-based swap activities in a safe and sound manner and 
mitigate systemic risk.

prohibition of federal assistance shall be made on an institution-by-
institution basis, and shall require the vote of not fewer than two-
thirds of the members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
which must include the vote by the Chairman of the Council, the Chairman

        of the House of Representatives shall hold a hearing examining 
        the findings of the report.
            (4) Biennial reporting.--In addition to the study required 
        in paragraph (1), the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
        Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress biennial 
        reports on the growth or decline of the derivatives markets in

    (b) Study on Feasibility of Requiring Use of Standardized 
Algorithmic Descriptions for Financial Derivatives.--
            (1) In general.--The Securities and Exchange Commission and 
        the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall conduct a joint 
        study of the feasibility of requiring the derivatives industry 
        to adopt standardized computer-readable algorithmic descriptions 
        which may be used to describe complex and standardized financial 
        derivatives.
            (2) Goals.--The algorithmic descriptions defined in the 
        study shall be designed to facilitate computerized analysis of 
        individual derivative contracts and to calculate net exposures 
        to complex derivatives. The algorithmic descriptions shall be 
        optimized for simultaneous use by--
                    (A) commercial users and traders of derivatives;
                    (B) derivative clearing houses, exchanges and 
                electronic trading platforms;
                    (C) trade repositories and regulator investigations 
                of market activities; and
                    (D) systemic risk regulators.
        The study will also examine the extent to which the algorithmic 
        description, together with standardized and extensible legal

[[Page 124 STAT. 1656]]

        definitions, may serve as the binding legal definition of 
        derivative contracts. The study will examine the logistics of 
        possible implementations of standardized algorithmic 
        descriptions for derivatives contracts. The study shall be 
        limited to electronic formats for exchange of derivative 
        contract descriptions and will not contemplate disclosure of 
        proprietary valuation models.
            (3) International coordination.--In conducting the study, 
        the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures 
        Trading Commission shall coordinate the study with international 
        financial institutions and regulators as appropriate and 
        practical.
            (4) Report.--Within 8 months after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall jointly submit to the 
        Committees on Agriculture and on Financial Services of the House 
        of Representatives and the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
        and Forestry and on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
        Senate a written report which contains the results of the study 
        required by paragraphs (1) through (3).

        Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission

                    (A) relating to--
                          (i) swap regulation in the United States, 
                      Asia, and Europe; and
                          (ii) clearing house and clearing agency 
                      regulation in the United States, Asia, and Europe; 
                      and
                    (B) that identifies areas of regulation that are 
                similar in the United States, Asia and Europe and other 
                areas of regulation that could be harmonized

        Services of the House of Representatives a report that includes 
        a description of the results of the study under subsection (a), 
        including--
                    (A) identification of the major exchanges and their 
                regulator in each geographic area for the trading of 
                swaps and security-based swaps including a listing of 
                the major contracts and their trading volumes and 
                notional values as well as identification of the major 
                swap dealers participating in such markets;
                    (B) identification of the major clearing houses and

    (d) Stable Value Contracts.--
            (1) Determination.--
                    (A) Status.--Not later <<NOTE: Deadline. Study.>>  
                than 15 months after the date of the enactment of this 
                Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
                Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall, jointly, 
                conduct a study to determine whether stable value 
                contracts fall within the definition of a swap. In 
                making the determination required under this 
                subparagraph, the Commissions jointly shall consult with 
                the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, 
                and the State entities that regulate the issuers of 
                stable value contracts.
                    (B) Regulations.--If the Commissions determine that 
                stable value contracts fall within the definition of a 
                swap, the Commissions jointly shall determine if an 
                exemption for stable value contracts from the definition 
                of swap is appropriate and in the public interest. The 
                Commissions shall issue regulations implementing the 
                determinations required under this paragraph. Until the 
                effective date of such regulations, and notwithstanding 
                any other provision of this title, the requirements of 
                this title shall not apply to stable value contracts.
                    (C) Legal certainty.--Stable value contracts in 
                effect prior to the effective date of the regulations 
                described in subparagraph (B) shall not be considered 
                swaps.
            (2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``stable value contract'' means any contract, agreement, or 
        transaction that provides a crediting interest rate and guaranty 
        or financial assurance of liquidity at contract or book value 
        prior to maturity offered by a bank, insurance company, or other 
        State or federally regulated financial institution for the 
        benefit of any individual or commingled fund available as an 
        investment in an employee benefit plan (as defined in section 
        3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,

        section 403(b) of such Code, or a qualified tuition program (as 
        defined in section 529 of such Code).

                      EXCHANGE SWAPS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS 
                      FROM DEFINITION OF THE TERM `SWAP'.

    ``(a) Required Considerations.--In determining whether to exempt 
foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition 
of the term `swap', the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this 
section as the `Secretary') shall consider--
            ``(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign 
        exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create 
        systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial 
        stability of the United States;

        forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is 
        materially comparable to that established by this Act for other 
        classes of swaps;
            ``(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants in 
        the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision,

    ``(b) Determination.--If the Secretary makes a determination to 
exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the 
definition of the term `swap', the Secretary shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a determination that contains--
            ``(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps 
        and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from 
        other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign 
        exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for 
        regulation as swaps; and
            ``(2) an identification of the objective differences of 
        foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with 
        respect to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.

    ``(c) Effect of Determination.--A determination by the Secretary 
under subsection (b) shall not exempt any foreign exchange swaps and 
foreign exchange forwards traded on a designated contract market or swap 
execution facility from any applicable antifraud and antimanipulation 
provision under this title.''.

                        INTEREST.

    (a) In General.--In <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  order to mitigate conflicts 
of interest, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the 
Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission shall adopt rules which may include numerical 
limits on the control of, or the voting rights with respect to, any 
derivatives clearing organization that clears swaps, or swap execution 
facility or board of trade designated as a contract market that posts 
swaps or makes swaps available for trading, by a bank holding company 
(as defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 
U.S.C. 1841)) with total consolidated assets of $50,000,000,000 or more, 
a nonbank financial company (as defined in section 102) supervised by 
the Board, an affiliate of such a bank holding company or nonbank 
financial company, a swap dealer, major swap participant, or associated 
person of a swap dealer or major swap participant.

    (b) Purposes.--The Commission shall adopt rules if it determines, 
after the review described in subsection (a), that such rules are 
necessary or appropriate to improve the governance of, or to mitigate 
systemic risk, promote competition, or mitigate conflicts of interest in 
connection with a swap dealer or major swap participant's conduct of 
business with, a derivatives clearing organization, contract market, or 
swap execution facility that clears or posts swaps or makes swaps 
available for trading and in which such swap dealer or major swap 
participant has a material debt or equity investment.
    (c) Considerations.--In adopting rules pursuant to this section, the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall consider any conflicts of 
interest arising from the amount of equity owned by a single investor, 
the ability to vote, cause the vote of, or withhold votes entitled to be 
cast on any matters by the holders of the ownership interest, and the 
governance arrangements of any derivatives clearing organization that 
clears swaps, or swap

                technologically practicable after the time at which the 
                security-based swap transaction has been executed.

    (b) <<NOTE: 15 USC 8342.>>  Savings Clause.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this title, nothing in this subtitle shall be 
construed as divesting any appropriate Federal banking agency of any

SEC. 765. <<NOTE: 15 USC 8343.>>  RULEMAKING ON CONFLICT OF 
                        INTEREST.

    (a) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  In General.--In order to mitigate conflicts 
of interest, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the 
Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission shall adopt rules which may include numerical 
limits on the control of, or the voting rights with respect to, any 
clearing agency that clears security-based swaps, or on the control of 
any security-based swap execution facility or national securities 
exchange that posts or makes available for trading security-based swaps, 
by a bank holding company (as defined in section

[[Page 124 STAT. 1797]]

2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841)) with total 
consolidated assets of $50,000,000,000 or more, a nonbank financial 
company (as defined in section 102) supervised by the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, affiliate of such a bank holding company 
or nonbank financial company, a security-based swap dealer, major 
security-based swap participant, or person associated with a security-
based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.

    (b) Purposes.--The Securities and Exchange Commission shall adopt 
rules if the Commission determines, after the review described in 
subsection (a), that such rules are necessary or appropriate to improve 
the governance of, or to mitigate systemic risk, promote competition, or 
mitigate conflicts of interest in connection with a security-based swap 
dealer or major security-based swap participant's conduct of business 
with, a clearing agency, national securities exchange, or security-based 
swap execution facility that clears, posts, or makes available for 
trading security-based swaps and in which such security-based swap 
dealer or major security-based swap participant has a material debt or 
equity investment.
    (c) Considerations.--In adopting rules pursuant to this section, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission shall consider any conflicts of 
interest arising from the amount of equity owned by a single investor, 
the ability to vote, cause the vote of, or withhold votes entitled to be 
cast on any matters by the holders of the ownership interest, and the 
governance arrangements of any derivatives clearing organization that 
clears swaps, or swap execution facility or board of trade designated as 
a contract market that posts swaps or makes swaps available for trading.

consultation with the prudential regulators and the Secretary of the 
Treasury, that the purchase or sale of the security-based swap, or class 
of security-based swap, provides incidents of ownership comparable to 
direct ownership of the equity security, and that it is necessary to 
achieve the purposes of this section that the purchase or sale of the 
security-based swaps, or class of security-based swap, be deemed the 
acquisition of beneficial ownership of the equity security.''.

   TITLE <<NOTE: Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 
2010.>>  VIII--PAYMENT, CLEARING, AND SETTLEMENT SUPERVISION
SEC. 801. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5301 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Payment, Clearing, and Settlement 
Supervision Act of 2010''.
SEC. 802. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5461.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The proper functioning of the financial markets is 
        dependent upon safe and efficient arrangements for the clearing

[[Page 124 STAT. 1803]]

        and settlement of payment, securities, and other financial 
        transactions.
            (2) Financial market utilities that conduct or support 
        multilateral payment, clearing, or settlement activities may 
        reduce risks for their participants and the broader financial 
        system, but such utilities may also concentrate and create new 
        risks and thus must be well designed and operated in a safe and 
        sound manner.
            (3) Payment, clearing, and settlement activities conducted 
        by financial institutions also present important risks to the 
        participating financial institutions and to the financial 
        system.
            (4) Enhancements to the regulation and supervision of 
        systemically important financial market utilities and the 
        conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and 
        settlement activities by financial institutions are necessary--
                    (A) to provide consistency;
                    (B) to promote robust risk management and safety and 
                soundness;
                    (C) to reduce systemic risks; and

SEC. 804. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5463.>>  DESIGNATION OF SYSTEMIC 
                        IMPORTANCE.

    (a) Designation.--
            (1) Financial stability oversight council.--The Council, on 
        a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of

        Chairperson of the Council, shall designate those financial 
        market utilities or payment, clearing, or settlement activities 
        that the Council determines are, or are likely to become, 
        systemically important.
            (2) Considerations.--In determining whether a financial 
        market utility or payment, clearing, or settlement activity is, 
        or is likely to become, systemically important, the Council 
        shall take into consideration the following:
                    (A) The aggregate monetary value of transactions 
                processed by the financial market utility or carried out 
                through the payment, clearing, or settlement activity.
                    (B) The aggregate exposure of the financial market 
                utility or a financial institution engaged in payment, 
                clearing, or settlement activities to its 
                counterparties.
                    (C) The relationship, interdependencies, or other 
                interactions of the financial market utility or payment, 
                clearing, or settlement activity with other financial 
                market utilities or payment, clearing, or settlement 
                activities.
                    (D) The effect that the failure of or a disruption 
                to the financial market utility or payment, clearing, or 
                settlement activity would have on critical markets, 
                financial institutions, or the broader financial system.
                    (E) Any other factors that the Council deems 
                appropriate.

        a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of members then serving, 
        including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, 
        shall rescind a designation of systemic importance for a 
        designated financial market utility or designated activity if 
        the Council determines that the utility or activity no longer 
        meets the standards for systemic importance.
            (2) Effect of rescission.--Upon rescission, the financial 
        market utility or financial institutions conducting the activity 
        will no longer be subject to the provisions of this title or any

                Trading Commission is the Supervisory Agency or the

                Council, and shall explain why existing prudential 
                requirements, considered as a whole, are insufficient to 
                ensure that the operations and activities of the 
                designated clearing entities or the activities of 
                financial institutions described in subparagraph (B)

                Board of Governors' determination shall contain a 
                detailed analysis supporting its findings and identify 
                the specific prudential requirements that are 
                insufficient.

                with a detailed analysis as to why existing prudential 
                requirements are sufficient, or submit an explanation to 
                the Council and the Board of Governors describing the 
                actions to be taken in response to the Board of 
                Governors' determination.
                    (E) Authorization.--Upon an affirmative vote by not 
                fewer than 2/3 of members then serving on the Council, 
                the Council shall either find that the response 
                submitted under subparagraph (D) is sufficient, or 
                require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the 
                Commission, as applicable, to prescribe such risk 
                management standards as the Council determines is 
                necessary to address the specific prudential 
                requirements that are determined to be insufficient.''

Act or the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 3C(a) of the

        respect to transaction reporting or trade execution.

    (e) Threshold Level.--The standards prescribed under subsection (a) 
governing the conduct of designated activities by financial institutions

significance of engagement in the activity at which a financial 
institution will become subject to the standards with respect to that 
activity.
    (f) Compliance Required.--Designated financial market utilities and 
financial institutions subject to the standards prescribed under 
subsection (a) for a designated activity shall conduct their operations

section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 342) to the designated 
financial market utility that the Federal Reserve Bank is authorized 
under the Federal Reserve Act to provide to a depository institution,

                market utility.

                period for an additional 60 days for proposed changes 
                that raise novel or complex issues, subject to the 
                Supervisory Agency providing the designated financial 
                market utility with prompt written notice of the 
                extension. Any extension under this subparagraph will

    (a) Examination.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and 
subject to subsection (d), the Supervisory Agency shall conduct 
examinations of a designated financial market utility at least once

        the designated financial market utility.
            (2) The financial and operational risks presented by the 
        designated financial market utility to financial institutions,

            (3) The resources and capabilities of the designated 
        financial market utility to monitor and control such risks.
            (4) The safety and soundness of the designated financial

                    (B) the rules and orders prescribed under this 
                title.

    (b) Service Providers.--Whenever a service integral to the operation 
of a designated financial market utility is performed for the designated 
financial market utility by another entity, whether an affiliate or non-
affiliate and whether on or off the premises of the designated financial 
market utility, the Supervisory Agency may examine whether the provision

utility were performing the service on its own premises.
    (c) Enforcement.--For purposes of enforcing the provisions of this 
title, a designated financial market utility shall be subject to, and 
the appropriate Supervisory Agency shall have authority under the 
provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of section 8 of the Federal

same extent as if the designated financial market utility was an insured 
depository institution and the Supervisory Agency was the appropriate 
Federal banking agency for such insured depository institution.

            (1) Board of governors consultation on examination 
        planning.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The Supervisory Agency shall

        conducted under subsections (a) and (b)
            (2) Board of governors participation in examination.--The

            (1) Recommendation.--The Board of Governors may, after 
        consulting with the Council and the Supervisory Agency, at any 
        time recommend to the Supervisory Agency that such

[[Page 124 STAT. 1815]]

        agency take enforcement action against a designated financial 
        market utility in order to prevent or mitigate significant 
        liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial 
        markets or to the financial stability of the United States. Any 
        such recommendation for enforcement action shall provide a 
        detailed analysis supporting the recommendation of the Board of 
        Governors.
            (2) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Consideration.--The Supervisory 
        Agency shall consider the recommendation of the Board of

        in whole or in part, the recommendation of the Board of 
        Governors, the Board of Governors may refer the recommendation 
        to the Council for a binding decision on whether an enforcement 
        action is warranted.
            (4) Enforcement action.--Upon an affirmative vote by a 
        majority of the Council in favor of the Board of Governors' 
        recommendation under paragraph (3), the Council may require the 
        Supervisory Agency to--
                    (A) exercise the enforcement authority referenced in 
                subsection (c); and
                    (B) take enforcement action against the designated 
                financial market utility.

    (f) Emergency Enforcement Actions by the Board of Governors.--
            (1) Imminent risk of substantial harm.--The Board of 
        Governors may, after consulting with the Supervisory Agency and 
        upon an affirmative vote by a majority the Council, take 
        enforcement action against a designated financial market utility 
        if the Board of Governors has reasonable cause to conclude 
        that--
                    (A) either--
                          (i) an action engaged in, or contemplated by, 
                      a designated financial market utility (including 
                      any change proposed by the designated financial 
                      market utility to its rules, procedures, or 
                      operations that would otherwise be subject to 
                      section 806(e)) poses an imminent risk of 
                      substantial harm to financial institutions, 
                      critical markets, or the broader financial system 
                      of the United States; or
                          (ii) the condition of a designated financial 
                      market utility poses an imminent risk of 
                      substantial harm to financial institutions, 
                      critical markets, or the broader financial system; 
                      and
                    (B) the imminent risk of substantial harm precludes 
                the Board of Governors' use of the procedures in 
                subsection (e).
            (2) Enforcement authority.--For purposes of taking 
        enforcement action under paragraph (1), a designated financial 
        market utility shall be subject to, and the Board of Governors 
        shall have authority under the provisions of subsections (b) 
        through (n) of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
        (12 U.S.C. 1818) in the same manner and to the same extent as if 
        the designated financial market utility was an insured 
        depository institution and the Board of Governors was the 
        appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured depository 
        institution.

        of Governors and the Council in such frequency and form as 
        deemed necessary by the Board of Governors or the Council in 
        order to assess the safety and soundness of the utility and the

        applicable to brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons 
        associated with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with 
        investment advisers is a source of confusion for retail 
        customers regarding the quality of personalized investment 
        advice that retail customers receive;
            (5) the regulatory, examination, and enforcement resources 
        devoted to, and activities of, the Commission, the States, and a 
        national securities association to enforce the standards of care 
        for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons associated 
        with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with investment 
        advisers when providing personalized investment advice and

    (g) Authority to Establish a Fiduciary Duty for Brokers and 
Dealers.--
            (1) Securities exchange act of 1934.--Section 15 of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o) is amended by 
        adding at the end the following:

    ``(k) Standard of Conduct.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commission 
        may promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to a broker 
        or dealer, when providing personalized investment advice about 
        securities to a retail customer (and such other customers as the 
        Commission may by rule provide), the standard of conduct for 
        such broker or dealer with respect to such customer shall be the 
        same as the standard of conduct applicable to an investment 
        adviser under section 211 of the Investment Advisers Act of 
        1940. The receipt of compensation based on commission or other 
        standard compensation for the sale of securities shall not, in 
        and of itself, be considered a violation of such standard 
        applied to a broker or dealer. Nothing in this section shall 
        require a broker or dealer or registered representative to have 
        a continuing duty of care or loyalty to the customer after 
        providing personalized investment advice about securities.
            ``(2) Disclosure of range of products offered.--Where a 
        broker or dealer sells only proprietary or other limited range 
        of products, as determined by the Commission, the Commission may 
        by rule require that such broker or dealer provide notice to 
        each retail customer and obtain the consent or acknowledgment of 
        the customer. The sale of only proprietary or other limited 
        range of products by a broker or dealer shall not, in and of 
        itself, be considered a violation of the standard set forth in 
        paragraph (1).

    ``(l) Other Matters.--The Commission shall--
            ``(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear 
        disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their 
        relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, 
        including any material conflicts of interest; and
            ``(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules 
        prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of 
        interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and 
        investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the 
        public interest and the protection of investors.''.
            (2) Investment advisers act of 1940.--Section 211 of the 
        Investment Advisers Act of 1940, <<NOTE: 15 USC 80b-11.>>  is 
        further amended by adding at the end the following new 
        subsections:

    ``(g) Standard of Conduct.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Commission may promulgate rules to 
        provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, 
        and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment 
        advice about securities to retail customers (and such other 
        customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to 
        act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the 
        financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment 
        adviser providing the advice. In accordance with such

[[Page 124 STAT. 1829]]

        rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and 
        may be consented to by the customer. Such rules shall provide 
        that such standard of conduct shall be no less stringent than 
        the standard applicable to investment advisers under section 
        206(1) and (2) of this Act when providing personalized 
        investment advice about securities, except the Commission shall 
        not ascribe a meaning to the term `customer' that would include 
        an investor in a private fund managed by an investment adviser, 
        where such private fund has entered into an advisory contract 
        with such adviser. The receipt of compensation based on 
        commission or fees shall not, in and of itself, be considered a 
        violation of such standard applied to a broker, dealer, or 
        investment adviser.
            ``(2) Retail customer defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `retail customer' means a natural person, 
        or the legal representative of such natural person, who--
                    ``(A) receives personalized investment advice about 
                securities from a broker, dealer, or investment adviser; 
                and
                    ``(B) uses such advice primarily for personal, 
                family, or household purposes.

    ``(h) Other Matters.--The Commission shall--
            ``(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear 
        disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their 
        relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, 
        including any material conflicts of interest; and
            ``(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules 
        prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of 
        interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and 
        investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the 
        public interest and the protection of investors.''.

    (h) Harmonization of Enforcement.--
            (1) Securities exchange act of 1934.--Section 15 of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, <<NOTE: 15 USC 78o.>>  as 
        amended by subsection (g)(1), is further amended by adding at 
        the end the following new subsection:

    ``(m) Harmonization of Enforcement.--The enforcement authority of 
the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct 
applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment 
advice about securities to a retail customer shall include--
            ``(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to such violations provided under this Act; and
            ``(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to 
        an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 
        including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations, 
        and

the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of the 
standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing 
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer 
under this Act to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and sanctions 
violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment advisor 
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.''.
            (2) Investment advisers act of 1940.--Section 211 of the 
        Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended by subsection

[[Page 124 STAT. 1830]]

        (g)(2), is further amended by adding at the end the following 
        new subsection:

    ``(i) Harmonization of Enforcement.--The enforcement authority of 
the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct 
applicable to an investment adviser shall include--
            ``(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to such violations provided under this Act; and

SEC. 929Y. STUDY ON EXTRATERRITORIAL PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION.

    (a) <<NOTE: Public comment.>>  In General.--The Securities and 
Exchange Commission of the United States shall solicit public comment 
and thereafter conduct a study to determine the extent to which private 
rights of action under the antifraud provisions of the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-4) should be extended to cover--
            (1) conduct within the United States that constitutes a 
        significant step in the furtherance of the violation, even if 
        the securities transaction occurs outside the United States and 
        involves only foreign investors; and
            (2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a 
        foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.

    (b) Contents.--The study shall consider and analyze, among other 
things--
            (1) the scope of such a private right of action, including 
        whether it should extend to all private actors or whether it 
        should be more limited to extend just to institutional investors 
        or otherwise;
            (2) what implications such a private right of action would 
        have on international comity;
            (3) the economic costs and benefits of extending a private 
        right of action for transnational securities frauds; and
            (4) whether a narrower extraterritorial standard should be 
        adopted.

    (c) Report.--A report of the study shall be submitted and 
recommendations made to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
House not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act.
SEC. 929Z. GAO STUDY ON SECURITIES LITIGATION.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study on the impact of authorizing a private right of action 
against any person who aids or abets another person in violation of the 
securities laws. To the extent feasible, this study shall include--
            (1) a review of the role of secondary actors in companies 
        issuance of securities;
            (2) the courts interpretation of the scope of liability for 
        secondary actors under Federal securities laws after January 14, 
        2008; and
            (3) the types of lawsuits decided under the Private 
        Securities Litigation Act of 1995.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of

  Subtitle C--Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies

SEC. 931. <<NOTE: 15 USC 78o-7 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings and 
        the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and 
        institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities 
        and performances of credit rating agencies, including nationally 
        recognized statistical rating organizations, are matters of 
        national public interest, as credit rating agencies are central 
        to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient 
        performance of the United States economy.
            (2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized 
        statistical rating organizations, play a critical ``gatekeeper'' 
        role in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of 
        securities analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in 
        the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial 
        statements of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of 
        public oversight and accountability.
            (3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and 
        analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other 
        financial ``gatekeepers'' do, the activities of credit rating 
        agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should be 
        subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as 
        apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers.
            (4) In certain activities, particularly in advising 
        arrangers of structured financial products on potential ratings 
        of such products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of 
        interest that need to be carefully monitored and that therefore 
        should be addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give 
        clearer authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
            (5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on 
        structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. This 
        inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of 
        risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn 
        adversely impacted the health of the economy in the United 
        States and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates 
        increased accountability on the part of credit rating agencies.

        other services, including risk management advisory services, 
        ancillary assistance, or consulting services;

product'' means an asset-backed security, as defined in section 3(a)(77)

    (b) Study.--The Commission shall carry out a study of--
            (1) the credit rating process for structured finance 
        products and the conflicts of interest associated with the 
        issuer-pay and the subscriber-pay models;
            (2) the feasibility of establishing a system in which a 
        public or private utility or a self-regulatory organization 
        assigns nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
        to determine the credit ratings of structured finance products, 
        including--
                    (A) an assessment of potential mechanisms for 
                determining fees for the nationally recognized 
                statistical rating organizations;
                    (B) appropriate methods for paying fees to the 
                nationally recognized statistical rating organizations;
                    (C) the extent to which the creation of such a 
                system would be viewed as the creation of moral hazard 
                by the Federal Government; and
                    (D) any constitutional or other issues concerning 
                the establishment of such a system;
            (3) the range of metrics that could be used to determine the 
        accuracy of credit ratings; and
            (4) alternative means for compensating nationally recognized 
        statistical rating organizations that would create incentives 
        for accurate credit ratings.

    (c) Report and Recommendation.--Not later than 24 months after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the 
Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report 
that contains--
            (1) the findings of the study required under subsection (b); 
        and

        of the report under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by 
        rule, as the Commission determines is necessary or appropriate 
        in the public interest or for the protection of investors, 
        establish a system

[[Page 124 STAT. 1890]]

        for the assignment of nationally recognized statistical rating 
        organizations to determine the initial credit ratings of 
        structured finance products, in a manner that prevents the 
        issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured finance 
        product from selecting the nationally recognized statistical 
        rating organization that will determine the initial credit 
        ratings and monitor such credit ratings. In issuing any rule 
        under this paragraph, the Commission shall give thorough 
        consideration to the provisions of section 15E(w) of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as that provision would have 
        been added by section 939D of H.R. 4173 (111th Congress), as 
        passed by the Senate on May 20, 2010, and shall implement the 
        system described in such section 939D unless the Commission 
        determines that an alternative system would better serve the 
        public interest and the protection of investors.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may be 
        construed to limit or suspend any other rulemaking authority of

under section 15E(h)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(2)(B)) to prevent improper conflicts of interest arising 
from employees of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
providing services to issuers of securities that are unrelated to the 
issuance of credit ratings, including consulting, advisory, and other 
services.

                costs and benefits of options for mitigating such risks;

                conflicts of interest between covered entities that 
                engage in proprietary trading and the clients of the 
                institutions who use the firm to execute trades or who 
                rely on the firm to manage assets, and if so, the costs

    (b) Rulemaking, Orders, and Guidance.--
            (1) General authority.--The Director may prescribe rules and 
        issue orders and guidance, as may be necessary or appropriate to 
        enable the Bureau to administer and carry out the purposes and

            (2) Standards for rulemaking.--In prescribing a rule under 
        the Federal consumer financial laws--
                    (A) the Bureau shall consider--
                          (i) the potential benefits and costs to 
                      consumers and covered persons, including the 
                      potential reduction of access by consumers to

                          (ii) the impact of proposed rules on covered 
                      persons, as described in section 1026, and the 
                      impact on consumers in rural areas;
                    (B) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  the Bureau shall 
                consult with the appropriate prudential regulators or 
                other Federal agencies prior to proposing a rule and 
                during the comment process regarding consistency with 
                prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered 
                by such agencies; and
                    (C) if, during the consultation process described in 
                subparagraph (B), a prudential regulator provides the 
                Bureau with a written objection to the proposed rule of 
                the Bureau or a portion thereof, the Bureau shall 
                include in the adopting release a description of the 
                objection and the basis for the Bureau decision, if any, 
                regarding such objection, except that nothing in this 
                clause shall be construed as altering or limiting the 
                procedures under section 1023 that may apply to any rule 
                prescribed by the Bureau.
            (3) Exemptions.--
                    (A) In general.--The Bureau, by rule, may 
                conditionally or unconditionally exempt any class of 
                covered persons, service providers, or consumer 
                financial products or services, from any provision of 
                this title, or from any rule issued under this title, as 
                the Bureau determines necessary or appropriate to carry 
                out the purposes and objectives of this title, taking 
                into consideration the factors in subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Factors.--In issuing an exemption, as permitted 
                under subparagraph (A), the Bureau shall, as 
                appropriate, take into consideration--
                          (i) the total assets of the class of covered 
                      persons;
                          (ii) the volume of transactions involving 
                      consumer financial products or services in which 
                      the class of covered persons engages; and
                          (iii) existing provisions of law which are 
                      applicable to the consumer financial product or 
                      service and the extent to which such provisions

            (4) Exclusive rulemaking authority.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provisions of Federal law and except as provided in 
                section 1061(b)(5), to the extent that a provision of 
                Federal consumer financial law authorizes the Bureau and 
                another Federal agency to issue regulations under that 
                provision of law for purposes of assuring compliance 
                with Federal consumer financial law and any regulations 
                thereunder, the Bureau shall have the exclusive 
                authority to prescribe rules subject to those provisions 
                of law.
                    (B) Deference.--Notwithstanding 
                any <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  power granted to any 
                Federal agency or to the Council under this title, and 
                subject to section 1061(b)(5)(E), the deference that a 
                court affords to the Bureau with respect to a 
                determination by the Bureau regarding the meaning or 
                interpretation of any provision of a Federal consumer 
                financial law shall be applied as if the Bureau were the 
                only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or 
                administer the provisions of such Federal consumer 
                financial law.

    (c) Monitoring.--

[[Page 124 STAT. 1982]]

            (1) In general.--In order to support its rulemaking and 
        other functions, the Bureau shall monitor for risks to consumers 
        in the offering or provision of consumer financial products or 
        services, including developments in markets for such products or 
        services.
            (2) Considerations.--In allocating its resources to perform 
        the monitoring required by this section, the Bureau may 
        consider, among other factors--
                    (A) likely risks and costs to consumers associated 
                with buying or using a type of consumer financial 
                product or service;
                    (B) understanding by consumers of the risks of a 
                type of consumer financial product or service;
                    (C) the legal protections applicable to the offering 
                or provision of a consumer financial product or service, 
                including the extent to which the law is likely to 
                adequately protect consumers;
                    (D) rates of growth in the offering or provision of 
                a consumer financial product or service;
                    (E) the extent, if any, to which the risks of a 
                consumer financial product or service may 
                disproportionately affect traditionally underserved 
                consumers; or
                    (F) the types, number, and other pertinent 
                characteristics of covered persons that offer or provide 
                the consumer financial product or service.
            (3) Significant findings.--
                    (A) In general.--The 
                Bureau <<NOTE: Publication. Reports. Deadline.>>  shall 
                publish not fewer than 1 report of significant findings 
                of its monitoring required by this subsection in each 
                calendar year, beginning with the first calendar year 
                that begins at least 1 year after the designated 
                transfer date.
                    (B) Confidential information.--The Bureau may make 
                public such information obtained by the Bureau under 
                this section as is in the public interest, through 
                aggregated reports or other appropriate formats designed 
                to protect confidential information in accordance with 
                paragraphs (4), (6), (8), and (9).
            (4) Collection of information.--
                    (A) In general.--In conducting any monitoring or 
                assessment required by this section, the Bureau shall 
                have the authority to gather information from time to 
                time regarding the organization, business conduct, 
                markets, and activities of covered persons and service 
                providers.
                    (B) Methodology.--In order to gather information 
                described in subparagraph (A), the Bureau may--
                          (i) gather and compile information from a 
                      variety of sources, including examination reports 
                      concerning covered persons or service providers, 
                      consumer complaints, voluntary surveys and 
                      voluntary interviews of consumers, surveys and 
                      interviews with covered persons and service 
                      providers, and review of available databases; and
                          (ii) require covered persons and service 
                      providers participating in consumer financial 
                      services markets to file with the Bureau, under 
                      oath or otherwise, in such form and within such 
                      reasonable period of time as the Bureau may 
                      prescribe by rule or order, annual

[[Page 124 STAT. 1983]]

                      or special reports, or answers in writing to 
                      specific questions, furnishing information 
                      described in paragraph (4), as necessary for the 
                      Bureau to fulfill the monitoring, assessment, and 
                      reporting responsibilities imposed by Congress.
                    (C) Limitation.--The Bureau may not use its 
                authorities under this paragraph to obtain records from 
                covered persons and service providers participating in 
                consumer financial services markets for purposes of 
                gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable 
                financial information of consumers.
            (5) Limited information gathering.--In order to assess 
        whether a nondepository is a covered person, as defined in 
        section 1002, the Bureau may require such nondepository to file 
        with the Bureau, under oath or otherwise, in such form and 
        within such reasonable period of time as the Bureau may 
        prescribe by rule or order, annual or special reports, or

            (6) Confidentiality rules.--
                    (A) Rulemaking.--The Bureau shall prescribe rules 
                regarding the confidential treatment of information

                its authorities under Federal consumer financial law.
                    (B) Access by the bureau to reports of other

                      reports.--Upon providing reasonable assurances of 
                      confidentiality, the Bureau shall have access to 
                      any report of examination or financial condition 
                      made by a prudential regulator or other Federal 
                      agency having jurisdiction over a covered person 
                      or service provider, and to all revisions made to

                      Federal agency having jurisdiction over a covered 
                      person or service provider may, in its discretion, 
                      furnish to the Bureau any other report or other 
                      confidential supervisory information concerning 
                      any insured depository institution, credit union, 
                      or other entity examined by such agency under 
                      authority of any provision of Federal law.
                    (C) Access by other regulators to reports of the

[[Page 124 STAT. 1984]]

                      other report or other confidential supervisory 
                      information concerning such person examined by the

                are registered with the Bureau.
                    (C) Consultation with state agencies.--In developing 
                and implementing registration requirements under this 
                paragraph, the Bureau shall consult with State agencies 
                regarding requirements or systems (including coordinated 
                or combined systems for registration), where 
                appropriate.
            (8) Privacy considerations.--In collecting information from 
        any person, publicly releasing information held by the Bureau, 
        or requiring covered persons to publicly report information, the 
        Bureau shall take steps to ensure that proprietary, personal, or 
        confidential consumer information that is protected from public 
        disclosure under section 552(b) or 552a of title 5, United 
        States Code, or any other provision of law, is not made public

                provider, except--
                          (i) if the financial records are reasonably 
                      described in a request by the Bureau and the 
                      consumer provides written permission for the 
                      disclosure of such information by the covered 
                      person or service provider to the Bureau; or
                          (ii) as may be specifically permitted or 
                      required under other applicable provisions of law

        among other relevant factors, the effectiveness of the rule or 
        order in meeting the purposes and objectives of this title and 
        the specific goals stated by the Bureau. The assessment shall

        noncompliance.

    (c) Primary Enforcement Authority.--
            (1) The bureau to have primary enforcement authority.--To 
        the extent that the Bureau and another Federal agency are

        Bureau shall have primary authority to enforce that Federal 
        consumer financial law with respect to any person described in 
        subsection (a).
            (2) Referral.--Any Federal agency, other than the Federal 
        Trade Commission, that is authorized to enforce a Federal 
        consumer financial law may recommend, in writing, to the Bureau 
        that the Bureau initiate an enforcement proceeding with respect 
        to a person described in subsection (a), as the Bureau is 
        authorized to do by that Federal consumer financial law.
            (3) Backup enforcement authority of other federal agency.--

        the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date on which the 
        Bureau receives a recommendation under paragraph (2), initiate 
        an enforcement proceeding, the other agency referred to in

        performing follow up supervisory and support functions 
        incidental thereto, to assure compliance with such proceeding.

    (d) Service Providers.--A service provider to a person described in 
subsection (a) shall be subject to the authority of the Bureau under

Federal banking agency under section 7(c) of the Bank Service Company 
Act 12 U.S.C. 1867(c). <<NOTE: Coordination.>>  In conducting any 
examination or requiring any report from a service provider subject to

        subsection (a) that is supervised by the prudential regulator 
        and the Bureau, respectively--
                    (A) coordinate the scheduling of examinations of the 
                insured depository institution, insured credit union, or 
                other covered person described in subsection (a);
                    (B) conduct simultaneous examinations of each 
                insured depository institution or insured credit union, 
                unless such institution requests examinations to be 
                conducted separately;
                    (C) <<NOTE: Reports. Deadline.>>  share each draft 
                report of examination with the other agency and permit 
                the receiving agency a reasonable opportunity (which 
                shall not be less than a period of 30 days after the 
                date of receipt) to comment on the draft report before 
                such report is made final; and

[[Page 124 STAT. 1992]]

                    (D) prior to issuing a final report of examination 
                or taking supervisory action, take into consideration 
                concerns, if any, raised in the comments made by the 
                other agency.
            (2) Coordination with state bank supervisors.--The Bureau 
        shall pursue arrangements and agreements with State bank 
        supervisors to coordinate examinations, consistent with 
        paragraph (1).
            (3) Avoidance of conflict in supervision.--
                    (A) Request.--If the proposed supervisory 
                determinations of the Bureau and a prudential regulator 
                (in this section referred to collectively as the 
                ``agencies'') are conflicting, an insured depository 
                institution, insured credit union, or other covered 
                person described in subsection (a) may request the 
                agencies to coordinate and present a joint statement of 
                coordinated supervisory action.
                    (B) Joint statement.--The

                described in subsection (a).
            (4) Appeals to governing panel.--
                    (A) In general.--If the agencies do not resolve the 
                conflict or issue a joint statement required by 
                subparagraph (B), or if either of the agencies takes or 
                attempts to take any supervisory action relating to the 
                request for the joint statement without the consent of 
                the other agency, an insured depository institution, 
                insured credit union, or other covered person described 
                in subsection (a) may institute an appeal to a governing 
                panel, as provided in this subsection, not later than 30

                merchant, retailer, or seller of nonfinancial goods or 
                services, but only to the extent that such person--
                          (i) extends credit directly to a consumer, in 
                      a case in which the good or service being provided 
                      is not itself a consumer financial product or 
                      service (other than credit described in this 
                      subparagraph), exclusively for the purpose of

                      default.
                    (B) Applicability.--Subparagraph (A) does not apply 
                to any credit transaction or collection of debt, other 
                than as described in subparagraph (C)(i), arising from a 
                transaction described in subparagraph (A)--

                      of nonfinancial goods or services assigns, sells 
                      or otherwise conveys to another person such debt 
                      owed by the consumer (except for a sale of debt 
                      that is delinquent or otherwise in default, as

                      significantly exceeds the market value of the 
                      nonfinancial good or service provided, or the 
                      Bureau otherwise finds that the sale of the 
                      nonfinancial good or service is done as a 
                      subterfuge, so as to evade or circumvent the 
                      provisions of this title; or

[[Page 124 STAT. 1996]]

                          (iii) Initial year.--A merchant, retailer, or

                      rules thereunder, such merchant, retailer, or 
                      seller shall be deemed to meet the relevant 
                      industry size threshold described in clause 
                      (ii)(III) if such merchant, retailer, or seller 
                      meets the relevant industry size threshold to be a 
                      small business concern based on the number of 
                      employees, or other such applicable measure,

        transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or

        service, to be unlawful on the grounds that such act or practice

                    (A) the act or practice causes or is likely to cause 
                substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably 
                avoidable by consumers; and

        serve as a primary basis for such determination.

                interests of the consumer in selecting or using a 
                consumer financial product or service; or
                    (C) the reasonable reliance by the consumer on a 
                covered person to act in the interests of the consumer.

        this subsection shall be validated through consumer testing.

with a rule issued under this section shall be deemed to be in

        conduct a trial program that is limited in time and scope, 
        subject to specified standards and procedures, for the purpose 
        of providing trial disclosures to consumers that are designed to 
        improve upon any model form issued pursuant to subsection 
        (b)(1), or any other model form issued to implement an 
        enumerated statute, as applicable.
            (2) Safe harbor.--The standards and procedures issued by the 
        Bureau shall be designed to encourage covered persons to conduct 
        trial disclosure programs. For the purposes of administering 
        this subsection, the Bureau may establish a limited period 
        during which a covered person conducting a trial disclosure 
        program shall be deemed to be in compliance with, or may be 
        exempted from, a requirement of a rule or an enumerated consumer 
        law.
            (3) Public disclosure.--The rules of the Bureau shall 
        provide for public disclosure of trial disclosure programs, 
        which public disclosure may be limited, to the extent necessary 
        to encourage covered persons to conduct effective trials.

    (f) Combined Mortgage Loan Disclosure.--Not 
later <<NOTE: Deadline. Public comment.>>  than 1 year after the 
designated transfer date, the Bureau shall propose for public comment 
rules and model disclosures that combine the disclosures required under 
the Truth in Lending Act and sections 4 and 5 of the Real Estate 
Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, into a single, integrated disclosure 
for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws, unless the Bureau 
determines that any proposal issued by the Board of Governors and the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development carries out the same purpose.

                  Subtitle D--Preservation of State Law

SEC. 1041. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5551.>>  RELATION TO STATE LAW.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Rule of construction.--This title, other than sections 
        1044 through 1048, may not be construed as annulling, altering, 
        or affecting, or exempting any person subject to the provisions 
        of this title from complying with, the statutes, regulations, 
        orders, or interpretations in effect in any State, except to the 
        extent that any such provision of law is inconsistent with the 
        provisions of this title, and then only to the extent of the 
        inconsistency.
            (2) Greater protection under state law.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation 
        in effect in any State is not inconsistent with the provisions 
        of this title if the protection that such statute, regulation, 
        order, or interpretation affords to consumers is greater than 
        the protection provided under this title. A determination 
        regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or 
        interpretation in effect in any State is inconsistent with the 
        provisions of this title may be made by the Bureau on its own 
        motion or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by 
        any interested person.

    (b) Relation to Other Provisions of Enumerated Consumer Laws That 
Relate to State Law.--No provision of this title, except as provided in 
section 1083, shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding 
the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that 
relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect 
to such Federal law.
    (c) Additional Consumer Protection Regulations in Response to State 
Action.--
            (1) Notice of proposed rule required.--The Bureau shall 
        issue a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever a majority of the 
        States has enacted a resolution in support of the establishment 
        or modification of a consumer protection regulation by the 
        Bureau.
            (2) Bureau considerations required for issuance of final 
        regulation.--Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a 
        notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take 
        into account whether--

[[Page 124 STAT. 2012]]

                    (A) the proposed regulation would afford greater 
                protection to consumers than any existing regulation;
                    (B) the intended benefits of the proposed regulation 
                for consumers would outweigh any increased costs or 
                inconveniences for consumers, and would not discriminate 
                unfairly against any category or class of consumers; and
                    (C) a Federal banking agency has advised that the 
                proposed regulation is likely to present an unacceptable 
                safety and soundness risk to insured depository 
                institutions.
            (3) Explanation of considerations.--The Bureau--
                    (A) shall include a discussion of the considerations 
                required in paragraph (2) in the Federal Register notice 
                of a final regulation prescribed pursuant to this 
                subsection; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>>  
                whenever the Bureau determines not to prescribe a final 
                regulation, shall publish an explanation of such 
                determination in the Federal Register, and provide a 
                copy of such explanation to each State that enacted a 
                resolution in support of the proposed regulation, the 
                Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
                Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
                House of Representatives.
            (4) Reservation of authority.--No provision of this 
        subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the 
        authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards 
        established pursuant to this title in response to its own motion 
        or in response to a request by any other interested person.
            (5) Rule of construction.--No provision of this subsection 
        shall be construed as exempting the Bureau from complying with 
        subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code.
            (6) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``consumer protection regulation'' means a regulation that the 
        Bureau is authorized to prescribe under the Federal consumer 
        financial laws.

                and to secure remedies under provisions of this title or 
                remedies otherwise provided under other law.

        regulator to enforce such Federal law.

                against any covered person as authorized by subsection 
                (a) to enforce any provision of this title, including 
                any regulation prescribed by the Bureau under this

                      coordinate the prosecution of the proceeding so as 
                      not to interfere with any action, including any

                thoroughness evident in the consideration of the agency, 
                the validity of the reasoning of the agency, the 
                consistency with other valid determinations made by the

Comptroller of the Currency prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(B), shall 
be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise declare 
inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State consumer 
financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the record of the 
proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding the preemption of 
such provision in accordance with the legal standard of the decision of 
the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, 
N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25

        adjudication proceeding and only to the extent of such 
        limitation.

    (b) Special Rules for Cease-and-desist Proceedings.--
            (1) Orders authorized.--
                    (A) In general.--If, in the opinion of the Bureau, 
                any covered person or service provider is engaging or 
                has engaged in an activity that violates a law, rule, or 
                any condition imposed in writing on the person by the 
                Bureau, the Bureau may, subject to sections 1024, 1025, 
                and 1026, issue and serve upon the covered person or 
                service provider a notice of charges in respect thereof.
                    (B) Content of notice.--The 
                notice <<NOTE: Deadlines.>>  under subparagraph (A) 
                shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the 
                alleged violation or violations, and shall fix a time 
                and place at which a hearing will be held to determine 
                whether an order to cease and desist should issue 
                against the covered person or service provider, such 
                hearing to be held not earlier than 30 days nor later 
                than 60 days after the date of service of such notice, 
                unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Bureau, 
                at the request of any party so served.
                    (C) Consent.--Unless the party or parties served 
                under subparagraph (B) appear at the hearing personally 
                or by a duly authorized representative, such person 
                shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the 
                cease-and-desist order.

[[Page 124 STAT. 2026]]

                    (D) Procedure.--In the event of consent under 
                subparagraph (C), or if, upon the record, made at any 
                such hearing, the Bureau finds that any violation 
                specified in the notice of charges has been established, 
                the Bureau may issue and serve upon the covered person 
                or service provider an order to cease and desist from 
                the violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions 
                which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the covered 
                person or service provider to cease and desist from the 
                subject activity, and to take affirmative action to 
                correct the conditions resulting from any such 
                violation.
            (2) Effectiveness of order.--A cease-and-desist order shall 
        become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date of 
        service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered person 
        or service provider concerned (except in the case of a cease-
        and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become 
        effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain 
        effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such 
        extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, or set 
        aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.
            (3) Decision and appeal.--Any hearing provided for in this 
        subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in 
        the territory in which the residence or principal office or 
        place of business of the person is located unless the person 
        consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance 
        with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5 of the United States 
        Code. After <<NOTE: Deadline. Notification. Order.>>  such 
        hearing, and within 90 days after the Bureau has notified the 
        parties that the case has been submitted to the Bureau for final 
        decision, the Bureau shall render its decision (which shall 
        include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) 
        and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an 
        order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. 
        Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as 
        provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is 
        timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as 
        provided in paragraph (4), and thereafter until the record in 
        the proceeding has been filed as provided in paragraph (4), the 
        Bureau may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as 
        the Bureau shall determine proper, modify, terminate, or set 
        aside any such order. Upon filing of the record as provided, the 
        Bureau may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with 
        permission of the court.
            (4) Appeal to court of appeals.--Any 
        party <<NOTE: Deadline. Petition.>>  to any proceeding under 
        this subsection may obtain a review of any order served pursuant 
        to this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent 
        of the person concerned) by the filing in the court of appeals 
        of the United States for the circuit in which the principal 
        office of the covered person is located, or in the United States 
        Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 
        days after the date of service of such order, a written petition 
        praying that the order of the Bureau be modified, terminated, or 
        set aside. <<NOTE: Records.>>  A copy of such petition shall be 
        forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Bureau, 
        and thereupon the Bureau shall file in the court the record in 
        the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28 of the 
        United States Code. Upon the filing of such petition, such court 
        shall have jurisdiction, which upon

[[Page 124 STAT. 2027]]

        the filing of the record shall except as provided in the last 
        sentence of paragraph (3) be exclusive, to affirm, modify, 
        terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the 
        Bureau. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in 
        chapter 7 of title 5 of the United States Code. The judgment and 
        decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall 
        be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, 
        upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28 of the 
        United States Code.
            (5) No stay.--The commencement of proceedings for judicial 
        review under paragraph (4) shall not, unless specifically 
        ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued by 
        the Bureau.

    (c) Special Rules for Temporary Cease-and-desist Proceedings.--
            (1) In general.--Whenever the Bureau determines that the 
        violation specified in the notice of charges served upon a 
        person, including a service provider, pursuant to subsection 
        (b), or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause the person 
        to be insolvent or otherwise prejudice the interests of 
        consumers before the completion of the proceedings conducted 
        pursuant to subsection (b), the Bureau may issue a temporary 
        order requiring the person to cease and desist from any such 
        violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent 
        or remedy such insolvency or other condition pending completion 
        of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement 
        authorized under this subtitle. Such order shall become 
        effective upon service upon the person and, unless set aside, 
        limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by 
        paragraph (2), shall remain effective and enforceable pending 
        the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to 
        such notice and until such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the 
        charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order 
        is issued against the person, until the effective date of such 
        order.
            (2) Appeal.--Not later <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  than 10 days 
        after the covered person or service provider concerned has been 
        served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may 
        apply to the United States district court for the judicial 
        district in which the residence or principal office or place of 
        business of the person is located, or the United States District 
        Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting 
        aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or 
        effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the 
        administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges 
        served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court 
        shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.
            (3) Incomplete or inaccurate records.--
                    (A) Temporary order.--If a notice of charges served 
                under subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of 
                particular facts and circumstances, that the books and 
                records of a covered person or service provider are so 
                incomplete or inaccurate that the Bureau is unable to 
                determine the financial condition of that person or the 
                details or purpose of any transaction or transactions 
                that may have a material effect on the financial 
                condition of that person, the Bureau may issue a 
                temporary order requiring--

[[Page 124 STAT. 2028]]

                          (i) the cessation of any activity or practice 
                      which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to 
                      the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or 
                      records; or
                          (ii) affirmative action to restore such books 
                      or records to a complete and accurate state, until 
                      the completion of the proceedings under subsection 
                      (b)(1).
                    (B) Effective period.--Any temporary order issued 
                under subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) shall become effective upon service; and
                          (ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended 
                      by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), 
                      shall remain in effect and enforceable until the 
                      earlier of--
                                    (I) the completion of the proceeding 
                                initiated under subsection (b) in 
                                connection with the notice of charges; 
                                or
                                    (II) the date the Bureau determines, 
                                by examination or otherwise, that the 
                                books and records of the covered person 
                                or service provider are accurate and 
                                reflect the financial condition thereof.

    (d) Special Rules for Enforcement of Orders.--
            (1) In general.--The Bureau may in its discretion apply to 
        the United States district court within the jurisdiction of 
        which the principal office or place of business of the person is 
        located, for the enforcement of any effective and outstanding 
        notice or order issued under this section, and such court shall 
        have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance 
        herewith.
            (2) Exception.--Except as otherwise provided in this 
        subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by 
        injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any 
        notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set 
        aside any such notice or order.

    (e) Rules.--The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing such 
procedures as may be necessary to carry out this section.
SEC. 1054. <<NOTE: 12 USC 5564.>>  LITIGATION AUTHORITY.

    (a) In General.--If any person violates a Federal consumer financial 
law, the Bureau may, subject to sections 1024, 1025, and 1026, commence

all appropriate legal and equitable relief including a permanent or 
temporary injunction as permitted by law.
    (b) Representation.--The Bureau may act in its own name and through

        insured credit union, the appropriate prudential regulator.
            (2) Notice and coordination.--
                    (A) Notice of other actions.--In addition to any 
                notice required under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall

[[Page 124 STAT. 2029]]

                notify the Attorney General concerning any action, suit, 
                or proceeding to which the Bureau is a party, except an 
                action, suit, or proceeding that involves the offering 
                or provision of consumer financial products or services.
                    (B) Coordination.--In 
                order <<NOTE: Consultation. Deadline.>>  to avoid 
                conflicts and promote consistency regarding litigation 
                of matters under Federal law, the Attorney General and 
                the Bureau shall consult regarding the coordination of 
                investigations and proceedings, including by negotiating 
                an agreement for coordination by not later than 180 days 
                after the designated transfer date. The agreement under 
                this subparagraph shall include provisions to ensure

                the Federal consumer financial laws are conducted in a 
                manner that avoids conflicts and does not impede the 
                ability of the Attorney General to prosecute violations 
                of Federal criminal laws.
                    (C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph 
                shall be construed to limit the authority of the Bureau

for writ of certiorari, and the Attorney General concurs with such 
request or fails to take action within 60 days of the request of the 
Bureau.

                    (C) the severity of the risks to or losses of the

            (2) Investigation by secretary of labor.--

                date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph 
                (1), and after affording the complainant and the person 
                named in the complaint who is alleged to have committed 
                the violation that is the basis for the complaint an 
                opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a 
                written response to the complaint and an opportunity to 
                meet with a representative of the Secretary of Labor to 
                present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of 
                Labor shall--
                          (i) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  initiate an 
                      investigation and determine whether there is 
                      reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has 
                      merit; and
                          (ii) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  notify the 
                      complainant and the person alleged to have 
                      committed the violation of subsection (a), in 
                      writing, of such determination.
                    (B) Notice of relief available.--If 
                the <<NOTE: Order.>>  Secretary of Labor concludes that 
                there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of 
                subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary of Labor 
                shall, together with the notice under subparagraph 
                (A)(ii), issue a preliminary order providing the relief 
                prescribed by paragraph (4)(B).
                    (C) Request for hearing.--Not later than 30 days 
                after the date of receipt of notification of a 
                determination of the Secretary of Labor under this 
                paragraph, either the person alleged to have committed 
                the violation or the complainant may file objections to 
                the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request 
                a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections 
                shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy 
                contained in the preliminary order. Any such hearing 
                shall be conducted expeditiously, and

[[Page 124 STAT. 2033]]

                if a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the 
                preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is 
                not subject to judicial review.
            (3) Grounds for determination of complaints.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of Labor shall 
                dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection, and 
                shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required 
                under paragraph (2), unless the complainant makes a 
                prima facie showing that any behavior described in 
                paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a 
                contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action 
                alleged in the complaint.
                    (B) Rebuttal evidence.--Notwithstanding a finding by 
                the Secretary of Labor that the complainant has made the 
                showing required under subparagraph (A), no 
                investigation otherwise required under paragraph (2) 
                shall be conducted, if the employer demonstrates, by 
                clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would 
                have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the 
                absence of that behavior.
                    (C) Evidentiary standards.--The Secretary of Labor 
                may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has 
                occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any 
                behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of 
                subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the 
                unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint. 
                Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the 
                employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence 
                that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable 
                personnel action in the absence of that behavior.
            (4) Issuance of final orders; review procedures.--
                    (A) Timing.--Not later than 120 days after the date 
                of conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), the 
                Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order providing 
                the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the 
                complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, 
                a proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on 
                the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the 
                Secretary of Labor, the complainant, and the person 
                alleged to have committed the violation.
                    (B) Penalties.--
                          (i) Order of secretary of labor.--If, in 
                      response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), 
                      the Secretary of Labor determines that a violation 
                      of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary of 
                      Labor shall order the person who committed such 
                      violation--
                                    (I) to take affirmative action to 
                                abate the violation;
                                    (II) to reinstate the complainant to 
                                his or her former position, together 
                                with compensation (including back pay) 
                                and restore the terms, conditions, and 
                                privileges associated with his or her 
                                employment; and
                                    (III) to provide compensatory 
                                damages to the complainant.
                          (ii) Penalty.--If an <<NOTE: Assessment.>>  
                      order is issued under clause (i), the Secretary of 
                      Labor, at the request of the complainant, shall 
                      assess against the person against

[[Page 124 STAT. 2034]]

                      whom the order is issued, a sum equal to the 
                      aggregate amount of all costs and expenses 
                      (including attorney fees and expert witness fees) 
                      reasonably incurred, as determined by the 
                      Secretary of Labor, by the complainant for, or in 
                      connection with, the bringing of the complaint 
                      upon which the order was issued.
                    (C) Penalty for frivolous claims.--If the Secretary 
                of Labor finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is 
                frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the 
                Secretary of Labor may award to the prevailing employer 
                a reasonable attorney fee, not exceeding $1,000, to be 
                paid by the complainant.
                    (D) De novo review.--

                      secretary to act.--If the Secretary of Labor has 
                      not issued a final order within 210 days after the 
                      date of filing of a complaint under this 
                      subsection, or within 90 days after the date of 
                      receipt of a written determination, the 
                      complainant may bring an action at law or equity 
                      for de novo review in the appropriate district 
                      court of the United States having jurisdiction, 
                      which shall have jurisdiction over such an action 
                      without regard to the amount in controversy, and 
                      which action shall, at the request of either party 
                      to such action, be tried by the court with a jury.
                          (ii) Procedures.--A proceeding under clause 
                      (i) shall be governed by the same legal burdens of

                      have jurisdiction to grant all relief necessary to 
                      make the employee whole, including injunctive 
                      relief and compensatory damages, including--
                                    (I) reinstatement with the same 
                                seniority status that the employee would 
                                have had, but for the discharge or 
                                discrimination;
                                    (II) the amount of back pay, with 
                                interest; and
                                    (III) compensation for any special 
                                damages sustained as a result of the 
                                discharge or discrimination, including 
                                litigation costs, expert witness fees, 
                                and reasonable attorney fees.
                    (E) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Other appeals.--Unless the 
                complainant brings an action under subparagraph (D), any 
                person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order 
                issued under subparagraph (A) may file a petition for 
                review of the order in the United States Court of 
                Appeals for the circuit in which the violation with 
                respect to which the order was issued, allegedly 
                occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided 
                on the date of such violation, not later than 60 days 
                after the date of the issuance of the final order of the 
                Secretary of Labor under subparagraph (A). Review shall 
                conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The 
                commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph 
                shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a 
                stay of the order. An order of the Secretary of Labor 
                with respect to which review could have been obtained 
                under this subparagraph shall not be subject to judicial 
                review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.

            (5) Failure to comply with order.--
                    (A) Actions by the secretary.--If any person has 
                failed to comply with a final order issued under 
                paragraph (4), the Secretary of Labor may file a civil 
                action in the United States district court for the 
                district in which the violation was found to have 
                occurred, or in the United States district court for the 
                District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In actions 
                brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall 
                have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief 
                including injunctive relief and compensatory damages.
                    (B) Civil actions to compel compliance.--A person on 
                whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (4) may 
                commence a civil action against the person to whom such 
                order was issued to require compliance with such order. 
                The appropriate United States district court shall have 
                jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in 
                controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to 
                enforce such order.
                    (C) Award of costs authorized.--The court, in 
                issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award 
                costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and 
                expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court 
                determines such award is appropriate.
                    (D) Mandamus proceedings.--Any nondiscretionary duty 
                imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a 
                mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 
                28, United States Code.

    (d) Unenforceability of Certain Agreements.--
            (1) No waiver of rights and remedies.--Except as provided 
        under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, the rights and remedies provided for in this section may 
        not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of 
        employment, including by any predispute arbitration agreement.
            (2) No predispute arbitration agreements.--Except as 
        provided under paragraph (3), and notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, no predispute arbitration agreement shall be 
        valid or enforceable to the extent that it requires arbitration 
        of a dispute arising under this section.
            (3) <<NOTE: Regulation.>>  Exception.--Notwithstanding 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), an arbitration provision in a collective 
        bargaining agreement shall be enforceable as to disputes arising 
        under subsection (a)(4), unless the Bureau determines, by rule, 
        that such provision is inconsistent with the purposes of this 
        title.

                temporary promotion, or other temporary action) 
                immediately before the date of transfer, the Bureau may 
                reduce the rate of basic pay on the date on which the

                      (c), and ending on the 7th day after that date

    ``(a) Ability To Repay.--
            ``(1) In general.--In accordance with regulations prescribed 
        by the Board, no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan 
        unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith 
        determination based on verified and documented information that, 
        at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a 
        reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, 
        and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage 
        guarantee insurance), and assessments.
            ``(2) Multiple loans.--If the creditor knows, or has reason 
        to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured

        creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, 
        based on verified and documented information, that the consumer 
        has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all 
        loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans

        paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations, 
        employment status, and other financial resources other than the 
        consumer's equity in the dwelling or real property that secures 
        repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the ability of 
        the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully 
        amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.
            ``(4) Income verification.--A creditor making a residential 
        mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such 
        creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including 
        expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer's Internal 
        Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, 
        financial institution records, or other third-party documents 
        that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's 
        income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent 
        reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in 
        making a determination under this subsection shall include the 
        verification of such income by the use of--

                    ``(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being

        subtitle;
            (2) on the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain 
        financing;
            (3) on the ability of homeowners facing resets or

        refinancing options due to the unavailability of certain loan 
        products that were available before the enactment of this Act;

            (6) of extending the rescission right, if any, on adjustable 
        rate loans and its impact on litigation;
            (7) of State foreclosure laws and, if any, an investor's 
        ability to transfer a property after foreclosure;

capital reserves and funding of lenders of credit risk retention 
provisions for non-qualified mortgages, including an analysis of the 
exceptions and adjustments authorized in section 129C(b)(3) of the Truth 
in Lending Act and a recommendation on whether a uniform standard is

supplemental directives and other guidelines for the Home Affordable 
Modification Program of the Making Home Affordable initiative of the 
Secretary of the Treasury, authorized under the Emergency Economic 
Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343), to require each mortgage 
servicer participating in such program to provide each borrower under a 
mortgage whose request for a mortgage modification under the Program is 
denied with all borrower-related and mortgage-related input data used in 
any net present value (NPV) analyses performed in connection with the 
subject mortgage. Such input data shall be provided to the borrower at 
the time of such denial.
    (b) Web-based Site for NPV Calculator and Application.--
            (1) NPV calculator.--In carrying out the Home Affordable 
        Modification Program, the Secretary shall establish and maintain 
        a site on the World Wide Web that provides a calculator for net 
        present value analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's 
        methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use

        disclose that each mortgage servicer participating in such 
        Program may use a method for calculating net present value of a 
        mortgage that is different than the method used by such 
        calculator.
            (3) Application.--The Secretary shall make a reasonable 
        effort to include on such World Wide Web site a method for 
        homeowners to apply for a mortgage modification under the Home

                  Subtitle H--Miscellaneous Provisions

SEC. 1491. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
                          GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM 
                          TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, 
                          AND REGULATION OF THE TERMS OF 
                          RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE CREDIT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National 
        Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan 
        Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress 
        to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, 
        but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations 
        with Government mandated affordable housing goals.
            (2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's 
        mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels 
        below the median for a given area.
            (3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their 
        overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated 
        that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac be ``special affordable'' loans made to borrowers 
        with incomes less than 60 percent of an area's median income, a 
        target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008.
            (4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals, 
        in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime 
        securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.
            (5) After this authorization to purchase subprime 
        securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 
        percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, 
        while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 
        78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a 
        corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 
        percent to 32.7 percent over the same period.
            (6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased 
        $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which 
        accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 
        through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately 
        $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie 
        Mae's acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down 
        payments almost tripled.
            (7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance 
        Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated 
        mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 
        percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and 
        have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the 
        residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of 
        outstanding mortgage debt in the United States.
            (8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury

[[Page 124 STAT. 2206]]

        Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least 
        $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in 
        exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each 
        enterprise's common stock.
            (9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has 
        potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 
        worth of risk.
            (10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that 
        consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on 
        terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans 
        and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or 
        abusive.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the 
terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such 
credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural 
reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
